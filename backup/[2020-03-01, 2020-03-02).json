            "selftext": "Hey Guys,\n\nI live in a large apartment complex for students on my university campus. I have continually had issues with their electronic key card system (like a plastic hotel key).  They continually \"demagnitize\" and result in me getting locked out of my apartment. My complex will recode if if this happens but it becomes an issue after the office is closed. In this case I have to sit on a help line to get some office hours worker to come buzz me back in. This has happened 6-10 times to me this year, a few times it took me over 3 hours before someone on the help line answered and let me in. I've been told the keys demagnitize and that I need to be careful with where I put it, and so I've tried my best to do that (I even bought a plastic holder for it that's supposed to help). They also refuse to give out extra cards in case yours fails (this detail is important for later). Anyways, this was not a major problem to me, I just figured it was a shitty system and something I had to deal with. \n\nToday something happened and I think it's super shady and I want to do something about it. \n\nSo my roomate lost his card, and went to the office to have it replaced. So they gave him a new card after an outrageous fee, and that was that. After this, suddenly the keycards of myself and my roomates no longer work, only the person who just got his replaced has a functioning key. Thats when it clicked for me, this has happened before, anytime someone has gotten a new key, all the other have stopped working (we only didn't notice before because we all just figured our keys had demagnitized and got them replaced at different times without talking about it). I am nearly certain that when a key is missing and replaced, my complex changes the rfid code on the lock to prevent someone from acquiring a second key to the apartment, and this in turn makes the other keys non-functional. They made no attempt to contact  me or my roomates to let us know our keys would stop working. Knowing that this is intentional, and not just a random \"demagnitization\" has me pretty peeved and I'd really like to do something about it. \n\nI'm looking for any cases or tenant/landlord law about keyless entry systems or just door locks in general. I want to find something I can reference when I talk to them about this to try to get them to either stop messing with our locks or provide some kind of compensation. \n\nSorry this was super long winded and complicated. I doubt anyone is going to have anything on the subject but if you do I would really appreciate it. Thanks!",

I was pretty late so I was in a hurry. As I got my car off of the driveway, I saw that my rear view mirror was a little out of my desired position so I attempted to fix it. As I was fixing it, I saw this old dude (I think he's my neighbor, this is probably the second time I saw him) showing me the finger. At first I was a little confused as I wasn't sure what he was doing. I looked again and I see that he's absolutely showing me the finger.\n\nAt this point, me being my sensitive self, I roll my window down and I ask him, \"Were you showing me the middle finger?\" Old dude's like, \"huh... What? Are you talking to me?\" I ask him again, \"Were you showing me the middle finger?\" He starts to aggressively walk towards my car and he says, \"huh? What? Butterfingers?\" (Lol). Once again I ask him and then he says as he right next to my car, \"Oh... Yeah... So what I was showing you the finger?\" I ask him, \"Why? What did I do to you?\" Old dude says after a short break, \"Why were you looking at me?\"...\n\nAt this point, I figured there was no point in arguing. I was already late so I just drove off. My question here is, can I press charges for harassment? If not, should he do this again, can I then press charges?\n\nThank you for your time fellow redditors.",

I am 19 and the companies website says that you need to be 18 to purchase their products so I assumed that I would be fine and I placed an order. But in order to put in payment information you have to be 21 and so I lied about my age. I made the purchase and it charged to my debit card. However, for the order to be shipped you have to upload a picture of your ID to the website ([https://www.pax.com/](https://www.pax.com/)) which uses an age verification software called Veratad Technologies ([https://veratad.com/](https://veratad.com/)) which cross checks your ID with public records. So I stupidly uploaded a picture of my license which shows that I am 19 and not 21 like I had said when I paid for my purchase. Did I break the law? And when I fail the verification test what will happen? I am very concerned that I will not be refunded for my very expensive purchase, that I will be charged with fraud or that my credit card company will contact my mother because my checking account is linked to hers. Maybe I am worrying unnecessarily but I don't know anything about law and would love for someone with more expertise to tell me what I can expect to happen.

Telling me the wisdom teeth operation was safe to do with a pneumonia sinus infection, and it very much wasn\u2019t. \n\nAnyway.  I\u2019m in the ER for said infection (which obviously worsened severely) and terrified, because I have caught several doctors lying to my face. \n\nThey refuse to answer my questions about medication options.  They refuse to explain procedures.  They refuse to let me finish giving my medical history.  They refused to let me finish telling them my medication allergies\u2014which resulted in them almost killing me already.  They were about to inject a medication I\u2019m severely allergic to!  Good thing I stopped them to ask what it is!!! \n\nTheir response, \u201cyou didn\u2019t tell me you were allergic.\u201d  Me: \u201cI was trying but you didn\u2019t let me finish my history!  You walked out of the room while I was talking!\u201d\n\nThey interrupt me when I\u2019m trying to explain my medical history and literally don\u2019t let me finish practically a single sentence.  I\u2019m not talking lengthy things.  Literally I can barely fit a 5 word sentence in\u2014then they snap at me 10 minutes later and go, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me that???  You left that out of your history!\u201d\n\nThis has happened several times tonight. \n\n\u201cMa\u2019am, I didn\u2019t leave it out.  I was in the middle of explaining it when you changed the topic.\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cSir please.  I\u2019m not declining this medication.  I just want to know the side effects first.

I just asked questions about my treatment, I never declined it.  You walked out in the middle of me asking my treatment options.\u201d\n\nSo I\u2019m terrified.  I caught these doctors lying to me, and they\u2019re refusing to give me the correct care.  \n\nSo I want to record the conversation.  I\u2019m really a nice person, so I told the next doctor who walked in that this conversation would be recorded, for my safety and his. \n\nHe freaked out, and said that is \u201cagainst hospital policy\u201d.   I have asked to see a copy of said policy, and now they\u2019re looking for one. \n\nIs it legal to refuse me the right to record my own medical care?

            "selftext": "So here is the rundown, I lived at a house with 3 other guy\u2019s. We have 9 months left on the lease. We all worked in the drug treatment field and are all in recovery. Two months ago I got sick And was given prescription for pain meds. Having 3 years clean I thought I was good, well nope I wasn\u2019t , once I took one the spark was lit and I ended up using heroin send cocaine again. One of roommates went to move my car and saw some paraphernalia . The other three roommates did an intervention on me and I admitted to relapsing. We all came into agreement in beginning of anyone relapses they need to go to treatment. I had recently switched jobs so I didn\u2019t have private insurance yet, so getting into treatment wasn\u2019t easy but I got on a waiting list for two weeks away.  In our lease it says we cannot change the locks without the landlord permission and giving her a key, however one of the guys ended up installing an electronic lock and never telling the landlord. 3  days after our intervention I had slept over my girlfriend\u2019s house and when I had came home and they had changed combination on the lock. When I had got ahold of the guys they said I can\u2019t stay there until I go to treatment. I was annoyed but agreed to it. Finally ended up going to treatment, so only stayed in apartment for 4 days but paid my normal share that month.  When I came home , one guy had went through my room and through everything away he felt I shouldn\u2019t have including antidepressants I was prescribed. I also had about 40 Viagra that they used to buy at times but they said they \u201cthrew\u201d them away. When I was out and came they tested me and I passed. Two days later, here one guy come home and run upstairs and test me ( this guy I wasn\u2019t really friends with abs I used to be his boss. Like 2 days after second test, he asked me to pee for him again. I hadn\u2019t used but these where instant teats and one of the lines didn\u2019t appear, told him that and he was making big deal about it but told him I didn\u2019t use and I\u2019m going bed. Next day he asked me at 11 PM for test told him couldn\u2019t go and I\u2019ll drink some water. I ended up falling asleep and next morning he left for work before I got up. Getting annoyed I spent next 4 days at my GF house and he called and said they where having house meeting, so I got to house and he was going on about how he unhappy in life, trying to say it about me but really bc girl he likes has him so far in frien zone he needs rescue team to get out. He test me and I tell him gonna fail bc took Xanax and it ended up having fentanyl in it. He says I gotta go treatment, knowing I won\u2019t be able get in so I tell him the truth I only used one night. He says I can\u2019t stay there till I\u2019m clean so I go to my girlfriends, while there I get really sick and end up going hospital for 4 days when I get out I\u2019m still not feeling great so I go to my dads for 3 days. He called me once that week but I didn\u2019t feel like talking to him. When he calls second time I answer and tell him was in hospital I\u2019m come pee for you tomorrow, he says ok abs hangs up. When I get there I say come on I can pee and he says don\u2019t worry about it and hands me piece paper that he wrote saying he gonna put his name on lease instead of mine. Me and another guy are main lease holders and his name was written as someone who lives there and there another guy that was never mentioned. Not only that but they had went and through all my stuff in bags and boxes and put it in garage and changed the lock combo again. I had just paid 450$ towards next two cable bills and had put up 1300$ for my share of security deposit. My names on lease still, like what are my options, can I call a locksmith and get locks changed. I can\u2019t get charged for c trespassing or anything right? Or if I break a window to get in, it\u2019s my window right I can\u2019t get charged with anything can I?  I don\u2019t want to live there but I want all my stuff and money and my name taken off lease so I can get my own place. Any advice? I wanted to beat his ass but putt my prison time behind Me and not trying live like that anymore.  So what do I do?",

The dude seemed so carefree about leaving the little guy and said he wouldn\u2019t come back. Now the frenchie, his name is Chopper now, was overweight (admittedly the owner said fed him Taco Bell other human food etc) dirty and was kept in a small cage most of the day (according to the owner) while he was at work. It was difficult in the beginning but we bonded and he\u2019s a really good boy if you take the time to train and play with him. Now after 6 months the previous owner, who grew up with my roommates, asks to have the dog for the day so his wife could hang with him because apparently her was her dog before he gave him up.  I felt sympathetic and agreed, knowing he grew up with my roommates and they trusted him. He had told me when they first took him to get his shots/vaccines that they had made a payment for two year, so they\u2019d be taking him for his second round of shots while they were hanging\nOut with him, he asked for the medical papers he gave me when I received Chopper. Well , now he\u2019s blocked me and texted my roommate that the dogs legally his, and the police have said I need to sue or find another way to get him back. I really need advice here, is me giving him the papers, even though it\u2019s technically entrapment, going to screw me? Do these cases ever get taken seriously?

            "selftext": "I\u2019m not really sure how to feel about this particular situation. We (my boyfriend and I) have been living in our apartment for 6 months and haven\u2019t had any problems with the maintenance men; however, yesterday we went over to a friends house for his birthday and left moderately early in the morning and we stayed up so late that we just spent the night over at his house. Come the next day I came home before my boyfriend did, and as I was turning my key to unlock the apartment I realized it didn\u2019t make a clicking noise, as if the door had never been locked. I specifically remember my boyfriend locking the door before we left. When I walked in I became nervous not knowing how or why my door was unlocked or if there was anybody in my apartment that wasn\u2019t supposed to be there. \n\nI walked into the kitchen to set some of my stuff down, I saw a maintenance note on my counter and immediately felt embarrassed as I had an extremely busy week and hadn\u2019t spent the proper time cleaning my apartment so I was a little embarrassed that anybody saw it this way as I normally don\u2019t like a dirty home. I began thinking it was routine maintenance, but when I read the note it said that there had been a request to look at my refrigerator and that I had said, \u201cfridge is not working and doesn\u2019t seem to have power\u201d. This felt a little strange as I knew I hadn\u2019t put in a request nor never noticed once that our refrigerator wasn\u2019t working properly. \n\nI immediately called my boyfriend and asked if he had put in a request to which he responded no, and then became upset because neither of us had called or put in an online work order. I even went to the app in my phone that I can pay rent and put in requests at to double check that I hadn\u2019t forgotten about one. Besides when we had just moved in and I had to schedule with the office when to resurface our bathtub (which they were supposed to do before we moved in so it wasn\u2019t really my request it was just setting up a time for them to do what they were already supposed to do) we hadn\u2019t put in any requests. They came in after we had left for our friends house as they have a printed time and date that they came in. \n\nI\u2019m not necessarily mad as I feel like the maintenance men haven\u2019t done anything to make me uncomfortable before, and they have certainly allowed us to get away with some things (like animals) that we probably should have gotten in trouble for. I am however uncomfortable about the fact that there\u2019s a false maintenance request on my counter, and my door was left unlocked overnight and majority of the next day. I\u2019m not quite ready to cause a riot over this situation as I believe it\u2019s the office\u2019s fault because when the company came in to resurface our tub our office told them they never scheduled an appointment and the poor guy that was sent had to become stern and call his boss before they said, \u201coh yes we did sorry\u201d and sent him over.\n\nI\u2019m curious as to how to properly document this and future instances, so if something were to happen I am prepared. All of my other apartments and rental homes have sent out emails or called/left a voicemail when they were even going to do basic maintenance such as exterminating and requests, and if it was urgent they always kept in contact through phone calls as to when to expect somebody. My boyfriend has been working overnights and I work during the mornings so there\u2019s never really a time when there isn\u2019t at least one person home, so I\u2019m also a little concerned as to why it seemed to happen the one time that neither of us were home. The sheet says that the priority of the request is high so they would have the authority to come in with nobody home but what if I never put in the high priority request in the first place? \n\nI have the paper and a screenshot of previous requests on my phone, do I need to do anything else and what should I be on the lookout for potential future issues like this?",

            "selftext": "I was living in Washington last year. At the end of September, I started renting a room from a homeowner (not a company) on their property. I signed a lease for 6 months. Unfortunately, at the end of November, I had a family emergency in my hometown in Texas and made the decision to move back to be with family.\n\nMy landlord and I were always on good terms, so I talked with them and let them know of my decision as soon as possible, and how best we should proceed. We agreed (verbally) that I would pay the full month's rent of December on the 1st as usual, and when I moved out (on the 8th), they would return half of my deposit then, and mail the other half in January after they find a new renter.\n\nI have spoken with them a few times since my move, and I now believe they have no intention of sending me the remainder of my security deposit as we agreed. They have either not responded to my questions, or try dodging the subject by saying they still needed to \"calculate\" how much they owe me.\n\nI know I'm not a savvy renter; I only just learned that there is a 3 week deadline for landlords to return a security deposit in Washington [RCW 59.18.280](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=59.18.280). And I tend to give people the benefit of the doubt. I just want to know if I have any options to move forward from here to get the rest of my deposit back, or if I should consider it a loss and an expensive learning lesson.\n\nI did break my lease sooner than the 6 months, but my landlord and I also did come to that new arrangement, even if it was verbal. And my lease, which was never edited by my landlord, is literally a single sheet of paper with a handwritten agreement, only detailing who is renting, for how long, and how much the rent is plus the security deposit. Nothing else. The \"offical\" lease my landlord told me they'd write up never came, even after I had asked about it early on during my stay.\n\nAlso, my co-workers told me I should be entitled to my full security deposit because my landlord never gave me a check-list [59.18.260](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=59.18.260)?\n\nAny help is greatly appreciated.",

Let me know if I\u2019m on the wrong sub or if this would fit elsewhere better. \n\nSo end of January I got a follow request from someone who looked vaguely familiar, but I couldn\u2019t place a reason as to why. So I asked after they messaged saying hello to me. They said that we used to \u201ctalk\u201d on Snapchat. I said I had no idea who he was. He then said I used to send him inappropriate picks back when I was in high school. I know I never should\u2019ve sent picks, but I was a young dumb teenager. I\u2019ve since learned my lesson. Well he sent me a screenshot of my old Snapchat that had been hacked and I had to involve the police which is a whole other story. I told him to remove the account unless he a) wanted to be scammed by the hacker who stole it or b) have his account hacked. He then sent a screenshot proving he had pics of me. The thing is these pics were taken when I was under 17 years old. The legal age of consent in my state is 17. \n\nHe then kept asking if I was interested in hooking up and asking for my address. I never gave it and said I wasn\u2019t interested in a hookup bc I\u2019m older and different. I said I wanted a relationship. He then said fine cool whatever. Until this past week.

My conservative parents moved back to their South Asian country when I was barely a few months ago.  \n\nI am currently 17 turning 18 in a month.  My decision to return to the US hasn't sat well with my parents.  My last passport expired when I was like 11.  Without getting into details, they are being extremely uncooperative about helping me get first adult passport.\n\nMy brother, who is also a US citizen, currently lives in the US, and he is coming back to India in a couple of months to help me out in getting my passport and getting out.  I am obviously going to apply once I am 18.\n\nI am looking at the documentation requirements for evidence of my citizenship, and I can easily meet two of them: my birth certificate and my expired passport.  My brother is going to go and notarize the forms needed to get my certified birth certificate tomorrow or so.\n\nThe thing I am missing is that I have no clue what my Social Security number is.  My parents refuse to tell me it.  They have also hidden the Social Security card away.  Is it okay if I do not know this for the passport or is there some way my brother can find out my Social Security number on my behalf?  Would it be listed on my California birth certificate?\n\nThe other thing I am worried about is that the US Consulate webpage requires \"Show parental awareness\" for my passport application where either my parent has to be present or they have sign DS-3053 form, both of which will never happen in a million years.  My brother will be accompanying me to the appointment at the Consulate when I take it.  Is there anyway around this requirement? Is there some sort of procedure we can establish we are siblings, like a DNA test or something?  \n\nAlso, the webpage says they can deny my passport if my parents object in writing.  My parents might probably do so. Will this be an issue if I am 18?\n \nBTW, 18 is the age of majority in the South Asian country I live in.  What is the age of majority for these kinds of things as far go?",

I have been abused as a young child and so was my younger sister. Traumatic amnesia is really problematic but is getting more and more well known. \nI did not remember events until I was 18 but what validated it all I that my sister talked to me about getting the same flashbacks of memories of abuse, same images, same time, same person, what saved me basically bc I know I wasn\u2019t getting insane.\n\nI am rarely going back to France (2 weeks a year since I study abroad) and I am there now, to file the police report and start the legal process, it took me 2 years to be able to talk about it without loosing it or dissociate, but now I am ready but I am really lacking of experience into using the right words, I am basically afraid that I might fuck it up due to the complexity of the traumatic amnesia thing so here are my two question : \n\nWhat to say and what not, I terms of words etc\u2026I really doubt that I will ever get anything from this, since French police laugh in your face about those things (last time I went happened to me, and reported it but anyway other story\u2026) this time I got an appointment with an investigating officer specialised in those events, I know she will listen to me and not laugh in my face, but again, I have to use the right words. \n\nAlso I am not going to lie : my blood is boiling, knowing that my abusers that tried to ruin my life are running free only 1h from where I am rn, there d\u00e9fense as always been that me and my sister where manipulated into lying because she never got over the divorce and blahblahblah\u2026I would want to do justice myself but I know I cannot so I come here as well to be calmed down about this.

My girlfriend had a very hard time coming out to her parents and she did so around two years ago. Backstory: Her mom adores her step uncle and calls him her brother all the time. So after coming out about the abuse her mom shed many crocodile tears and promised to get her a therapist which never happened. Her entire family soon learned about the abuse and swept it under the rug (which they have been known to do about similar secrets within their family). Her own sisters have shown their disdain for taking any action against him with remarks like \u201cyou\u2019ll ruin his life, etc...\u201d Her step uncle has lived out of state for some time so my girlfriend essentially wanted to just put all this behind her. Here\u2019s where things get fucked. Her aunt (who has two small children of her own) that lives a town over has made arrangements for step uncle to live with her knowing full well of what he\u2019s done. This affected my girlfriend severely though since he would still be a town over she just decided to forget about it and cut most of the toxic family members. My girlfriend has been attending a college through a dual enrollment program and has had to stay in touch with her mom due to her being legal guardian. Today her mom gave her an ultimatum: Move to the town with her abuser and toxic family members and finish school there OR drop out of school now and live on her own essentially.

She was diagnosed with RSV and bronchiolitis. Her lungs sounded perfect, her oxygen was at 100, she didn\u2019t have a cough or snot, no trouble breathing. We were sent home with Tylenol and told to get her checked on Wednesday Feb. 19th with baby\u2019s Dr. Her temp was going down with Tylenol and staying down for a few hours all day Tuesday. We were told this was normal for RSV at the ER despite showing no other symptoms of the RSV affecting her body. We brought her to our clinic to see her Dr. in the morning on Wed. Feb 15th her temp got up to 104 that morning before we arrived but the tylenol  brought it down to 100 by the time we arrived at the clinic. Her dr. was concerned, she thought something was wrong yet they didn\u2019t have the facilities to do any testing she rushed us to the ER and sent notes and called them to let them know we were coming. The ER was busy when we arrived. We were triaged then seen in the lobby. The dr asked us what our Dr was worried about and said she didn\u2019t see any of those things. She said that she would look at the notes our dr sent and she told us that despite showing no symptoms of the RSV besides the fever that it was in fact the RSV that was making her temp spike. She never came back, a nurse administered Tylenol and let us know we can wait and have her temp checked again. We did. Her temp was going down. We were sent home. Wednesday night was the same. Throughout the night I noticed baby was getting fussier and having difficulties eating (breastfed) by Thursday morning Feb. 20th I decided that the ER Drs must have missed something and that I was done trusting them we were going to drive back to the ER.  I checked baby\u2019s soft spot before we got in the car to find that it was bulging. We called an ambulance and were rushed back to the ER. Baby looked at me for the last time as the gurney was rolled into the ER and started having her first seizure. From that point on it is a blur. We are still in the PICU. They thought the Meningitis was textbook and normal and we were sent back to the normal pediatric floor for one night and her seizures started again by the time the MRI was done she had already suffered a severe brain injury. \nI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s important to note that we live an hour away from the ER and they were aware of that when treating us.

            "selftext": "First off, I\u2019m ok. Today has been so weird. Here\u2019s the story. \n\nToday was a beautiful day in Denver, CO. I took my dog for a walk (yes, he\u2019s ok too! Thank god!) down our typical path. A portion of the trail is closed right due to a flooded river so pedestrians and cyclists are forced to cross a fairly busy intersection. But this is a normal occurrence and anyone who drives through the area knows there are always people recreating outside. I get to the corner, hit the button and wait for my turn to walk across the street. As I am waiting I take account that there are two cars directly across the street, one going straight and a white one making a left turn, which would be towards me. When we all finally get a green light and my pedestrian walk sign goes off, I start to cross. I notice that white car starting to inch into the road preparing to make its turn. The next thing I know the car is accelerating right at me as I am in the middle of their path. I see I flash of the white hood and then I am on the road, looking at the car speeding away from me. I check my dog who, thankfully, is ok. I try and comprehend what just happens and another car swerved around me and drives off. I was so confused and questioning my reality. \n\nI get up and head back to the sidewalk. A few good samaritans stop and make sure I\u2019m ok. Another witness is already on the phone with 911. Before I know it, an ambulance pulls up and shortly behind it the police come. I start to explain what happened and all of a sudden another man approaches saying his wife needs help, she was in a domestic abuse situation and gestures towards me. At this point I realize he was one of the people in the car that hit me. He tries to tell the paramedics to come with him to his wife. I am even more confused. The paramedics ignore him and take me into the truck, do their thing and ask if I want to go to the ER. I decline since I think I\u2019m OK just super rattled, feeling numb and high off adrenaline but know that my foot really hurts. \n\nI call my partner and he arrives just as I exit the ambulance. As he arrives, I see the police escorting over the woman that hit me. I can see she has two black eyes. The police come over and ask me to fill out a statement and give me a case number. The ambulance drives off with the driver inside, presumably to a hospital. The husband at one point approaches me and apologizes. The police let me know that they will contact me later to follow up. My partner and I check our dog, drop him at home and head to the ER. \n\nI get an X-ray and confirm nothing is broken but I am pretty banged up. I can\u2019t put pressure on my foot, my thigh is sore from hitting the car, my knee is jacked up from landing on it (I think??) and now that I\u2019m in bed and trying to sleep my foot, thigh, shoulders, back and neck are hurting and I can\u2019t get comfortable. I know a lot of this discomfort it to be expected (I got hit by a freaking car!!!) but I\u2019m really torn about what to do next. When the officer called this evening to follow up and I ask about the driver. The officer confirm she had the \u201cshit beat out of her\u201d earlier this week, probably had a skull fracture and her brain is most likely swelling. The officer also said that the driver had sun in her eyes and had a weird shakey hesitation (according to her) and a \u201cmental malfunction\u201d, said she was sorry and owned the mistake. I asked the officer if she had insurance and thankfully she does. Also asked if she was intoxicated, she wasn\u2019t. She was given an citation for reckless driving. (Only a citation??? She hit me with her car and initially just drove off, quickly!!!) \n\nHere\u2019s the thing, the driver mostly likely saw me before I started to cross at the crosswalk. We both were waiting at the same light for at least a minute. I was wearing a yellow jacket, it was in the middle of the day. Plus I am a human sized human crossing the road with a dog. She started to enter her turn slowly as if she was waiting for me and accelerated a few feet away from me. I really can fathom wtf was going on with her. Is it possible her mental facilities escaped her for a moment? Sure. But she should have been driving! \n\nSo what do I do? I was hit by a fucking car by someone who shouldn\u2019t have been driving. I fully understand and empathized that as bad as my day was, her week sounds worse. But I\u2019m pissed! I don\u2019t want to pay this hospital bill or any other medical expenses due to this. (I feel like I might need to see a chiropractor.) I am on my feet, walking around for hours at work and I will have to miss a number of days until I can walk again. I don\u2019t want to be a person that sues but this whole situation is so weird and borderline fishy sounding...\n\nPlease advise!\n\nTL;DR: a driver that shouldn\u2019t have been driving hit me at a pedestrian crosswalk, drives away only to come back later. I\u2019m ok but pretty banged up. Will insurance cover all costs or do I sue?",

I know if I file with them it would open an investigation and freeze the funds, however I do not have access to their SSN and they are refusing to provide me with any information. What do I do? I was relying on this money for some medical bills (after I split half with them which I know I was not obligated to do). \n\nWe are about to begin a very long and messy divorce court battle, I have been cut off from my children by the entire family and unable to speak to them. I am paying above the state child support amount and trying to be the adult in this situation but I\u2019m getting stone walled at every turn. I\u2019m keeping from sinking to their level in this fight as at the end of the day it\u2019s not about us, it\u2019s about the children.",

I was able to bond out same day. My girlfriend is going to call the state attorneys office and says she doesn't want to press charges and it was all a big misunderstanding. Is that the right thing that we should do? Are there other actions we can take? Is there someone i should specifically contact? As well do we still have to go to court?

I also brought it up to some of my coworkers who also noticed a shot in their pay about 5 hours. At this time I noticed I was about 10 hours short on my paycheck. Thought nothing of it as they said it took a long time to do payroll for that week busy week makes sense. In this next payroll my employer added 5 additional hours to all paychecks to remedy the issue or so they said. what actually happened with my check is that I did in fact get that 5 hour addition but a clock in and out was not recorded in her record. I am now 12.5 hours behind on my paychecks, 7 hours if I can't count the time clock that got lost to her. \n\nMy question is that can I use their own video cameras to remedy the 5 hour gap or if i go to court for my hours am I only going to be able to go for the 7? as it's not in my employer system.\n\nThis whole thing isn't the first problem that has shown up just the first thing that I need more advice with. \n\nI will try my best to answer any and all questions that arise.

However the term porn is quite unclear. When translated it states that something that could stimulate someone's sexual desire is consider as porn and the exception to this is if it's for medical, artistic or education purposes etc. But purpose is decided by the average person and not the creator. There is also a law that states if there is something in the content that can be  related to a minor (a school uniform for example) it can be considered as child porn (unless specifically stated otherwise). And fiction characters can be judged also. And due to this the problem starts. And if you think that no one has been arrested for violating the fictional character thing, there has been examples of people reading hentai being convicted. \nSo the problem comes when we take the example of ecchi anime (It's a genere in\u00a0japanese anime\u00a0and manga that reffers to erotic but not abruptly sexual content) by the terms stated above it would be considered as porn. Lets take it further. A beach scene in filler episodes, although the purpose is to make a breather room in a story can be considered as erotic and therefore could be considered as porn. If we continue on where do we stop?\nAnd if characters can be judged as minor or not. Then lets take the example of Joseph Joestar(Jojo pt2) he is 18 in the majority of this story so lewding him would be child porn. HOWEVER we have a scene in this story which takes 11 years later puting him at 29yrs but he has the same design so legal or not? \nSo all and all what I'm trying to ask what can I portray when making stories.

My mom is my best friend and always supportive of me, even though I know I\u2019m a lot to handle. I have both mental and physical health issues including multiple types of anxiety and IBS. \n\nMy dad, however, treats me horribly. He isn\u2019t physically abusive, but he and his current wife have been emotionally abusive towards me since I was twelve. But I live in California, where the definition of emotional abuse is very vague and it isn\u2019t really considered in court. The current custody agreement is that my mom has 65% custody and my dad has 35%.\n\nThe real kicker though: my dad is the one with the money. He pays my mom a substantial amount in child and spousal support and my mom has confided in me that she\u2019s worried that he would make a problem out of the money stuff if we were to try to change the custody agreement. My mom is currently getting a second degree from a local university and her tuition is paid for by a professor who she works for part time. She will be graduating this June and already has a job lined up at a local hospital - but it is not going to pay as much as my dad\u2019s job does. \n\nMy mom and I have regarded going to court as a last resort, but I think it\u2019s time. He treats me like I am worth nothing. I drive myself and my sister back and forth to his house and back (about 15 miles each way, I pay for gas) every other weekend and one night a week, and he acts like it\u2019s a given because it would be \u201ctoo much of a strain on him\u201d to transport us himself. (His job would allow for that. He\u2019s in a very high position at an important company and he really is only in the office from about 10-5). I\u2019m on a very strict diet for my IBS and he acts very annoyed that he needs to accommodate it. When I ask to spend time with my friends or even to go to extracurriculars for school he tells me that I\u2019m stealing time from him, even though the majority of the time that I spend in his house he spends on his room with his wife or getting angry with her kids for small things like leaving plates on the table or not closing the windows. He never sees my accomplishments or appreciates me. I have a 4.01 GPA and he asks me why it isn\u2019t higher, I\u2019m the star of the school play and he asks me why it takes so much time, things like this. He just belittles everything I do and I have spent too many hours crying over the way he makes snarky comments about my body shape (I\u2019m not skinny. Just not. And I\u2019m okay with it but his wife and her kids are skinny and perfect), and acts like what is important to me (such as my friends and my school) no matter what need to be secondary to my responsibility to spend 35% of my time in his house. \n\nIt has gotten to the point where I can\u2019t deal with it anymore.

After spinning some bullshit story about how the dog was \u201cobviously abused\u201d because he peed in the house, she didn\u2019t want him anymore. After we accepted the dog, I did some digging on FB and found that she drove 2 1/2 hours out of town to get the dog, and surrendered him less than 12 hours later.\n\nShe is consistently screwing dogs out of a real home by adopting them (even when other people show interest in taking them to make a part of their family) just to turn around and surrender them. I\u2019m not talking once or twice, she has done this more than 20 times in the last six months. I don\u2019t understand at all what she is getting out of this. I have exhausted everything I can do from the SPCAs perspective. I\u2019ve put her name on the DNA list and shared this information with the other local SPCAs, but now that she is traveling hours away to continue this behavior, I don\u2019t know what else I can do. Is there anything I can report to the police in this situation? Or is she not breaking any laws?",

This is his story:\n\n\n\n\n*He has told me that due to his past he can't legally purchase a gun, but that he is allowed to own a gun. He says he was young at the time of his crime and that his rights (?) to own a gun were restored by the state government. However because his record was never expunged he still can't purchase a gun because his name is in a federal database. He says that if I were to gift him a gun, this would be legal. He has told me that he can have his record expunged because he was a youthful offender but has not done it yet.*\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional information: it is a handgun which I believe has specific requirements for purchase in WI. From what I was told years ago, his crime was armed robbery when he was under 20 years old. I don't know if that is the correct charge, but he has stated his age is why he would be able to have it expunged. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy question is does any of this check out? How can he legally own a gun but not legally purchase one? \n\n\n\n\n\nTo be clear, I have almost zero intention to go through with this plan. Because surprise! *My live in boyfriend can't own guns because of a felony and I'm pretty sure that having one myself will give him 'access to a gun' and then all three of us will have felonies*",

Boss said that I was exhibiting strange behavior in the work place throughout the week, and that I had previously mentioned that I was struggling with drinking problems (a couple of weeks ago I was talking with him in his office and yeah we did discuss it was a concern of mine). He brought up the fact that I had said I was day-drinking at times to cope with the stress of working full-time and going to school full-time to finish my degree. The fat lady from HR then told me that I was going to have to go in a cab that they were paying for down the road to a rehab clinic for a drug screening (breathalyzer and piss tests). I asked what was going to happen if I refused, to which she replied it would be considered a \"positive test result\" (back-dooring me into it) and they would \"move towards separation\" (fancy way of saying termination). I didn't have to sign anything, complied with their request, went in the cab to the rehab place. There, I signed a piece of paper stating that I understood why I was submitting to these tests. I blew 0.00% on the breath test and my piss blank showed 0.00%. Can they terminate me for any of this? I was on a \"performance plan\" (work probation) for unrelated incidents, but had completed this a couple of weeks ago and was no longer on it. It's a privately owned bank, so I know that gives them more leeway to do what they want in these circumstances. Any help or info is greatly appreciated.",

There is a woman and at least two children living there, although I saw a third child this evening as well. I\u2019m not sure if a man lives there too. It\u2019s only been three or four nights but already I have been woken up mornings around 7 by yelling, mostly kids but the mother too. I have heard the doors slam and so many thudding footsteps as the kids run through the small, two bedroom apartment, it\u2019s shaking the walls and scooting things on shelves. My kitten is scared and keeps hiding under the couch, not normal behavior for her.\nThis afternoon my roommate and I, who have lived in this apartment for over 2 years, were drinking coffee on our deck and heard the woman vomit in the front yard, then mention something about \u201cthe baby not liking eggs\u201d which led me to believe that she\u2019s 1-gross and 2-pregnant. I reiterate that they have not even lived here a full week.\nThe yelling, running and stomping went on for hours this evening, so long that I got my jacket on and went outside to see how loud it was from outside the building (it was audible), this is when I saw through some open blinds that 3 kids were running around unsupervised at after 10 pm. \nI escaped and went to a friend\u2019s house for a few hours, where I had an anxiety attack because of this stress. I have had a few in the past and know that this sort of \u201cinvasion\u201d of my space, even just audibly if it is unrelenting and uncontrollable like this, can wear me thin and make them more likely. \nIt is now after 2am and the television is on in the front bedroom so loud that I can hear it through my earplugs (never needed those before!) and I live in the back bedroom- not even right above the tv.\nI don\u2019t know what I can do about these new neighbors if they signed a lease. Mine isn\u2019t up until the end of the year. My roommate and I are going to speak with them tomorrow during the day, when we\u2019re not as upset, about how thin the walls and floors are. \nJust to cover my bases, I checked on the local laws for recording conversations and it seems like it isn\u2019t legal to record people in person when they don\u2019t know unless they could assume they could reasonably have known they were being recorded. I interpret that to mean that knocking on their door with a voice recorder going in my pocket is illegal, but recording the sounds I hear while in my apartment is ok because it\u2019s what they\u2019re just putting out into the world.\n\nTL;DR: new downstairs family is super noisy and disruptive of the quiet apartment building I\u2019ve lived in for over 2 years, day and night. Not sure what I should do, if I can do anything because my lease isn\u2019t up for 9 months. Please advise!",

Finally at the very end of the day she calls me. She acknowledges a mistake has been made but tells me theres nobody there to unlock it so I have to wait until tomorrow.\n     Tomorrow rolls around. Door is still locked. She is not answering her phone. After a few hours of waiting Im forced to send my employees home once again.\nShe finally calls me around noon telling me somebody will come unlock it later that day. That never happens and she doesnt answer her phone for the rest of the day.\n     Friday rolls around. Lock is still on the door.\nI call her up furious as hell.

It is a shallow well and the region has experienced an influx of people needing to dig deeper wells due to recent and significant changes in rainfall. After every significant amount of rain, the well water becomes discolored due to sediment (even after going through 3 water filters). The first time it happened, we were told it was expected and normal and to just change the filters. Our filters have never lasted the 3-6 months that they are supposed to, but they tend to do the job. The landlord has provided some, but not enough for replacing them every few weeks. Most recently, the 6 month filter we purchased lasted a week. It had become so overloaded with sediment that it had stopped the flow of water into the house completely. It was the presence of so much sediment that drove us to get the water tested the first time back in September. It came back positive for e. coli. The landlord shocked the well and it seemed to help. In January, however, we had a lot of rain and the sediment made us wary of the e. coli returning. We had the water tested again. It came back positive again. My husband had been experiencing symptoms of an e. coli infection that resolved shortly after we stopped cooking/drinking/brushing teeth with the water. The landlord had the well cleaned/shocked again. We waited about a week before drinking the water again. It tasted different, but that was expected. However, when my husband drank a significant amount of water it made him almost instantly sick. We tested it with a home testing kit and the copper level came out at maximum. We've had enough. We've asked the landlord to release us from the lease and he has agreed - but he wants to keep half of our deposit. I think this is a reasonable request, but my husband does not since we have not sought any compensation for the issues we've had (lost work, illness, filters, etc.).

Also the only way is with a legal fight for him and I\u2019m wondering what my chances are. My son\u2019s grandmother is 72 and has atrial fibrillation and like I said his daddy has no job and no drivers license and mental issues. I\u2019m just wondering what my chances are if I go for custody like would me bringing up the grandmother having that medical problem and his daddy\u2019s mental issues would help me or it wouldn\u2019t even matter?",

I\u2019ve been with the same company for ten years and now work the night shift alternating with one other person: two days on/two days off and alternating three day weekends. Normal shifts are ten hours and I\u2019m hourly so every other week I get overtime but on my three day weekends I only end up with around thirty two hours.\n\nFirst issue is: I haven\u2019t been able to take an actually vacation in four years. I can take days off here and there but taking a real vacation means my coworker has to work seventy hours straight - ten hour shifts and 12/13 hour shifts on Saturday and Sunday. The company is based out of MA. I\u2019ve asked again and again for some help on this. I continue to max out on PTO every month and for many months LOST time. I ended up quitting and they got me to stay with a boss and raise with the ability to submit pretend PTO hours so at least I don\u2019t lose them. This has been okay with me for two years because honestly I like the hours and the frequent days off. Just want to plan a vacation without needing to work and carry my laptop across the world. \n\nSecond issue is- my company refuses to pay me PTO for more than eight hours. My shifts are mandatory ten/eleven hours. If I do take time off, I suffer financially. So I have ended up avoiding taking time off or just submitting extra PTO to cover the difference. \n\nIs there anything sketchy about this from a legal standpoint? Can an employer not let you take more than 8 hours PTO at a time?",

I completed all of the paperwork and saw the fine print that basically provided all of the terms and conditions for the benefit, including that you have to stay with the company for one year following disbursement of the funds, otherwise you have to pay the money for the benefit back to them.\n\nLong story short, I ended up dropping the class (within the allotted 2 week add drop period) and didn't think anything of it. This would be September 2018. I ended up leaving my former company in January of 2019 and, of course, they attempted to garnish my wages in my last paycheck for some of the tuition benefit amount. It took a few hours of calling around to resolve this issue. I called the uni and confirmed that 1. I was never charged for the class (because I dropped it) and 2. They never processed (nor had they ever received) payment from my former employer for it. I took that back to my former employer and the apologetically wrote me a check for the garnished wages. All is well.\n\nFast forward to the new year and I'm getting phone calls from people claiming to be debt collectors - calling from \"credit management company.\" They leave non-descript voicemails, never saying who they're calling for so I assume that they're scammers trying to steal my identity and ignore them. I keep a very close eye on all of my debts and I am up to date on all of my payments with an \"exceptional\" payment history so I was pretty certain they were fraudulent. They were not.\n\nA couple of days ago, I get a notification that my Experian credit score has changed. I check and see that it has dropped 61 points over night. I also see that a \"delinquent\" account has appeared on my credit from the very same \"credit management company\" that had been calling. The descriptor for the account was \"Tuition Benefit\" from my old employer for the exact amount of the class I would have taken in the Fall of 2018. The account was apparently opened in December of 2019.\n\nI do have plans to call all parties involved, the uni, my former employer and the debt collectors but if anyone has any advice about this, I'd be glad to hear it.",

His parents think this is because of him having a lot of 'screentime' and as a result they prevent him from using his mobile or laptop to much. We have this app called 'kinky virgins' where we and our friend group discuss about everything. We have conversations about depression, sexual activity, basically everything. Recently his parents took his phone and they read his messages, also from Kinky Virgins. They found out he ordered some sexual toys behind their backs via another friend. Now they are asking for the friends parents numbers. They threatened to tell school and his parents everything if we don't give them his parent's numbers. How can we stop them from doing this? We are pretty sure this is not legal. If you know better subreddit for this please tell me in the comments.

I'd appreciate any feedback available. \n\n- Sorry for the wall of text below -\n\nFull story - \n\nI was referred out to the MD Anderson cancer treatment center in Houston in November of 2018, first visit was in December of 2018.  At the time my local oncologist was saying I had 3 to 5 lesions (tumors) in my liver still remaining after a pancreatic cancer diagnosis and treatment in Jan to March of 2018. Original diagnosis was Stage IV pancreatic cancer w metasis to the liver. Original treatment was removing primary tumor from pancreas (along w most of my pancreas) and burning out the largest 2 tumors from liver.   Then an injectable chemo, which didn't appear to help those remaining tumors in my liver after 9 mos. Since his treatment wasn't working he recommended some alternatives, or said he could refer me out for a second opinion. I chose the second opinion to better understand my options. \n\nAt MD Anderson, the oncologist there says between him and the radiologist they think the imaging is showing other medical issues that are mostly from the surgery I had (kind of like scar tissue?).  He recommends NO treatment and just monitoring it.  This goes on through all of 2019, with about 5 sets of imaging done by MRI, and each time saying it's not cancer and a recommendation that we continue to monitor.  then,  in November of 2019 they say there's still some lesions in my liver, so I return to my home oncologist and liver surgeon to resume treatment.  My home surgeon refers me for a scan that had been developed in the two years since my original surgery and comments that he's surprised MD Anderson never had it done while I was out there. THAT new scan shows I now have 17 lesions in my liver, and one in a lymph node nearby... So it's spread again.\n\nI've tried calling and emailing medical malpractice attorneys, and NOBODY wants to touch the possible claim for the missed diagnosis and bad advice to not do any treatment. the only kind of reason i got from one of the contacts was that because the hospital and doctor are part of UT it falls under Texas Tort Claims Act (?). I tried contacting attorneys that say they specialize in that act but they won't give me a reason at all other than they can't assist. One intake specialist just said \"none of our attorneys will go after MD Anderson\".\n\nIs that really it?  I have what's likely a viable claim that is life altering for me since it's spread out of the one organ it was left in, and I can't even TRY to hold the doctor and oncologist liable because the school is immune?  Or am I missing something here?",

We have been cohabitating for the last four years. We moved in when she bought the house. She has a 20 year mortgage. When we moved in the verbal agreement was that I would pay half of everything for the time being and only her name was on anything ownership related. I found this was unfair and spoke to her about it many times. She made the down payment and I was a Tennant. \n\nLately she has told me she does not want to get married. As I continue to pay half of our expenses I have begun to feel more and more upset that I am getting the short end of the stick. I spend a third of my income on her investment and we do not even have a rental agreement of any kind. I could live in the same city we live in for half the cost of living if I chose to. I do not want to do that. Another factor is that she bought a house that she cannot afford alone. \n\nI have decided I would either like marriage, coownership, or a rental agreement that allows me to invest some of my income. Things are fine now, but I am no fool. I work hard for my money and normal couples have a mutual benefit in these situations. I do not, I am in my mid thirties and essentially renting a room. I sat her down the other day and talked about this and at first she was upset, understandably, but I explained to her how this was not good for my financial future and she understood what I meant.\n\nMy question is what are my options besides marriage? I read about coownership agreements, but are these done through the bank? Can we come to a legal standing agreement through other avenues or am I just renting until the mortgage is paid off?",

Basketball is a high intensity, fast past, physical sport. Arms and hands are contently moving around, swinging, and slapping. And attached to these arms are these smart watch devices that are made of hard materials like glass, metals and hard plastics. You would think out of common courtesy one would take off their smart device to avoid injury to others. But on the other hand they can't track their workouts. \n\nSo what if someone swings one of these smart watches and it hits you square in the mouth and shatters your teeth? Thats one of my biggest concerns. I'm sure I'm not the first to think of this. \n\nSo who do I go after if this happens? Basketball can be played in a few different settings. Like an gym like an YMCA or LA Fitness. Maybe outside at public city park and even at someone's home in the driveway of someone's private residence. \n\nSo if this happens, who is responsible and how would someone handle this type of situation?",

She has never known her mother, and lives with her father, over 18 brother, and grandmother. They all contribute to abusing her in any way imaginable. She has not been ready to come forward about it for some time. She told my mother and I about it over 3 years ago. We encouraged her to come forward about it, but if she wasn\u2019t ready, to just gather as much evidence as possible. She has videos, pictures (one of when her brother was maliciously choking her), recordings, everything. She was finally ready to make her statement on a recent Friday. After four long hours, the caseworker on duty at the time had told her to stay with us for the weekend, because she told them her father would kill her if she went home. The following Monday, her permanent caseworker had come to the decision to put her back into the home, because of school. The caseworker was supposed to be there when we dropped her off at home. She was going to ask her if she could stay with another friend (we do not live in the same county). The caseworker never came, so she had to go into her house. The caseworker is trying to make this an open and shut case. They have thrown out every bit of evidence my friend has given authorities and the first caseworker. They are taking only her father\u2019s words into consideration. My friend had called her caseworker multiple times during open hours before we dropped her off at her house, saying that she fears for her life. The caseworker never answered. They are now trying to spin this as my friend is troubled because her mother left her at a young age. They are going to try to medicate her. She has been talking to her school counselor, and they want to help in any way possible, but there\u2019s only so much to be done if CPS does not want to do their job. My question is, what is our/my friends next step? The overall goal is to get her to live with my mother and I. Is CPS doing anything illegal we could file a lawsuit for? Would the legal system be less likely to allow her to stay with my mother and I because we are in another county? Will they even do anything given her age? We are so lost as to what to do next.",

I filed for paternity she happened to find out. The day I filed is the day she took the kids and moved 5 hours away from me and to another county in Florida.She unrolled them from school.. She was served papers at her moms and called me to ask why the address was where she \"used\" to live, she stated the paper says it was filed at 2pm she \"moved\" at 10am, claims she changed her license and everything to her moms. My lawyer filed and emergency petition for temporary relief which the judge said since we have NOT established paternity it has to go to a magistrate. She left on 2/18 I have seen my kids once since then on 2/23 when I had to drive 5 hours to see them she wouldn't even meet me half way.When I call to talk to the kids if it isn't on her not busy time she may let me speak to them for 5 mins,that is if she answers. She has stated that she wants me to move if I want to get 50/50 of the kids. She also says that if we leave it to a judge I am screwed because I am the dad and Florida is a moms rights state.And I will pay out the ass for her child support. My lawyer really keeps saying we just have to wait and see. I know he can't guarantee anything at all.

I saw that it's a 10 year and you're good rule, that might not even be true, but wasn't sure if that was 10 years from the date of OWI or 10 years from the punishment you received?

I can't find any of the documentation anymore to confirm exactly when the dates were.  I guess my question is am I ok to just cross the boarder?  It looks like I would be almost 13 years from date of incident on the fishing trip and looks like I've just gone 10 years from when I got my license reinstated.

We have this app called 'kinky virgins' where we and our friend group discuss about everything. We have conversations about depression, sexual activity, basically everything. The age of the group varies between 14 and 17. Recently, his parents took his phone and they read his messages, also from Kinky Virgins. They found out he ordered some sexual toys behind their backs via another friend (15, the package arrived at his parents house, because my friend believed his parents would not find out this way). Now they are asking for the friends parents numbers. They threatened to tell school and his parents everything if we don't give them his parent's numbers. Everyone in the group is afraid they will threaten everyone in there to tell everything or report everything to our parents. Is this legal? We live in the Netherlands.",

            "selftext": "This is a really complicated issue that has haunted me for almost half of my life and no one will help.  I've talked to lawyers, consumer advocates, news reporters, the ombudsman, the CFPB, even the ACLU -- and the Milwaukee Bar Association, twice -- and of the few that even bother to get back in touch with me, no one can help or even knows what to do.  99% of them don't even bother to reply.\n\nSo what's happened is I had been attending UW-Milwaukee (in Wisconsin) for a couple years and one day I get an email saying that my loan company had gone out of business and I needed to find a new lender.  I took out a private loan and all UWM had to do was take my money.  They never did.  I raised numerous concerns to both the lender and the college.  UWM said just check the PAWS site (their student portal) and it will tell me what needs to be done.  That is all I heard heard from them no matter what I tried to tell them.  Check the PAWS site.  PAWS was always stuck on \"nothing to do\".  My lender told me there was nothing that needed to be done on their end - everything was setup and UWM just had to take the money.  Ultimately, UWM never took the money, then kicked me out of school saying I owed them money - I think it was something around $5,000 but I don't remember the amount anymore.\n\nRegardless, for the next 5 years, my legal right to go to every accredited college in the united states was illegally denied to me because if you owe a college money, they will not send transcripts and if you switch from one college to another, they require those transcripts or you are denied any eligibility.  In addition to this, they had the IRS come after me illegally seizing my tax returns and even illegally freezing my checking account (I say illegally because no one had any legal right to do any of this given the fact that it was UWM's ERROR that kicked me out of school so I was not at fault for the outstanding balanced owed to them).  For 5 years I was harassed by both the university and the IRS.\n\nAt the start of all of this, I disputed UWM's claim that I owed them money.  Their attitude was always \"screw you pay me\".  I tried to talk to anyone who would listen, which was few and far between.  I'm guessing it's because they would have had to go up against a very large university but then again I have no idea because no one ever returned my calls or emails.  I only know this got even more complicated because I now live in Georgia and this took place in Wisconsin.\n\nAt the time, I was living in Milwaukee (obviously) and made something around $200 each check.  There was absolutely no way I could start paying back 3 years of student loans on income like that.  All I knew was that if I wanted to stave off these loans, I had to stay in school - you can't get out of student loans by filing bankruptcy -- and when the government wants its money they will take everything from you.  ITT Tech also said I could be thrown in jail if I didn't pay back the loans (I still have the paper where they say this in writing).  So I was forced to go to a for profit school (ITT Tech) because it is the only type of \"college\" you can go to that doesn't require transcripts if you previously attended a different college.  This was my attempt at racing to get a degree and a job that could pay off my loans before they came due.  I knew I should not be held responsible for what happened with the semester of tuition money I owed but I had to at least try and put myself in a position where I had a fighting chance to do *something*.\n\nUnfortunately, that school I went to was ITT Tech in Greenfield, Wisconsin.  I graduated about a year before they closed their doors.  The school was flat out fraud and I was concerned from the start but what could I do?  I had no other choice but to stay in school and at the time no one knew what they were doing so on the surface, it appeared that they were honest about graduation and job placement rates, etc.  They promised me a job in Wisconsin and a $90,000/year salary if I did made good grades.  I graduated at the top of my class with a cumulative 3.96 GPA and they still couldn't find me work anywhere in the state.  I was forced to leave Wisconsin and had to move across the country to Georgia to get work.  I lost my family, all my friends, everything.  I also started out at $28,000/year.  I got royally screwed.  I am not really going into detail about the ITT stuff unless people ask because I think it will distract from my main point, but in short I sent about 52 pages of evidence of fraud and deceptive practices from their own paperwork -- along with my DTR.  \n\nAbout a year after I graduated (2011), Navient comes into the picture (Sallie Mae at the time).  They wanted $1,000 a month to start on my $28,000/year salary.  I had to consolidate loans and go into Income Based Repayment.  There's no way I could pay a bill like that -- let alone every month, so I chose the box on their forms that said \"Choose the best option for me\" for repayment.  It turns out that best option for me doesn't even touch the interest added to the account each month so it's spiraled out of control and what started out as a $17,000 loan is now something around $75,000 -- all for an associates degree at a defunct and useless college and 3 years of education for a degree I never got and was wrongfully deprived of.\n\nThe whole time I tried to reason with UWM - a woman named Vicki Vaclaw was the person who almost always the face of any conversation I had.  I hold her personally responsible for the mess she put me in because all she wanted was money and did not care to look into anything or try to help me.  When the IRS came down on me and froze everything in my account - I was forced to talk to this vile woman once again who FINALLY told me there was a committee I could plead my case to and they might negate the tuition charges but it was highly unlikely and she basically wrote me off once again... after talking to her for at least a year when all of this first started... NOW she tells me???\n\nI took my statement to this committee and they decided I was wronged and removed the tuition charges against the semester that they failed to accept my payment for.  This released the freeze the IRS had on my account, refunded 5 years of seized state tax refunds, and removed the outstanding balance I owed UWM.  I received a letter on their university letterhead signed by the assistant dean of students admitting that it was their fault that they kicked me out of school.  I still have this letter.\n\nThat letter establishes a definitive timeline of just how long my legal right to go to any other college was wrongfully denied to me.  The letter is dated July 2013 and they specifically state that the semester in question was fall 2007-2008 - so they even admitted they did this to me for 5 years.  They admit their guilt right there but I can't find anyone to go after them?!\n\nI have wanted to sue them for denying me my right to go elsewhere and forcing me into the mess that I am in now.  I am trapped though because no one will listen to me at all and of those that do -- no one knows what to do.  I'm so lost on this but I'm trapped in a financial death sentence that is a direct result of their error they admit on their own letterhead, yet I'm the one left holding the bill for all of this.  How is this fair?\n\nIt eventually got to the point where I just gave up and stopped even trying to look for anyone to help me anymore because everytime I reach out it forces me to relive everything over and over and with not one single valid response from anyone I just can't keep doing this to myself.  It is destroying my mind.\n\nI did file Defense to Repayment as previously mentioned, and it's been in limbo for forever, but I think it only covers ITT loans, not UWM.  Either way, I shouldn't owe anything because I never got the degree I was paying for and ITT was just all out fraud.\n\nNavient just recently started their BS again saying I owe them money starting this month.  No matter what I do I cannot even get the interest paid on those loans so it's just going to keep going higher and higher along with my payments -- which started around $50/month and is now reaching $600 if they put everything together - and it gains 1% interest a DAY.  There's nothing that can stop it.  Even if I did send in money it's just flushing it down the toilet because it's not doing anything except lining their pockets.\n\nI want to sue UWM for what they did to me - for denying my legal right to go to any other college - for refunding my entire tuition fees while I was there since I was wrongfully denied the degree I was paying for and I will never go there again because I live in another state and was never able to use any credits earned towards going anywhere else anyways.  I want to sue for getting me out of this situation with ITT (which I would have never been in had they not erroneously kicked me out) - and for emotional damages.  You have no idea how mentally damaging this has been to me for the last 12 years.  I had to leave everything I knew and loved and I live so far out in the middle of nowhere now that there isn't even a police station here.  It's 10 miles to the nearest \"anything\" and I have an almost 100 mile daily round trip commute to/from work.  I have to work 16 hours a day to have any kind of decent lifestyle.  My mother only has me, and she lives in Green Bay and has crippling multiple sclerosis and all I can do is watch her struggle because I'm down here.  It leaves me completely helpless.  Futhermore, I can't even send her any money because it will count against her as income and she has to depend the government for support -- everything from housing to food.\n\nThe reason why I'm forcing myself to tell my story yet again is because UWM has now entered my workplace as a client, and I have to face this fact every day now.  The last two months have just destroyed me.  I want to quit but I can't find work elsewhere that won't bring drastic change to my life in a negative way.  I'm stuck.  And now that I'm slapped in the face everyday with the fact that I now have to build tools to help them - it's just a really messed up way of adding insult to injury and I cannot stop thinking about this.\n\nAll I ever tried to do was get an education to better myself, and I get kicked out of college for no valid reason, forced into a for profit school (which no one knew at the time what was happening with these types of schools) - and everyone is having a field day with my loans.  If this is not the definition of cruel and unusual punishment -- then I don't know wtf is.  This is not right.  And no one will help.  No one has ever helped.  And I doubt anyone ever will.  I have no hope - I don't even know why I bother writing this now... but I guess this is just a last ditch attempt at getting the word out there.  I've never used reddit before - I don't even really know what this site is all about.  I just noticed there was a legal section so for what it's worth, I tried.  I really, really tried.  What can I do though when everyone turns their back on me?\n\nI don't know what to do anymore...",

My friend called the police on me one night because he thought I needed mental health help but the police suspected domestic violence and arrested me. Everything was cleared in court, but the arrest was really traumatic and I can't help but wonder if there is something more I can do. \n\nMy friend called the police on my one night after I vented about my stress (I'm a college student).  He was afraid I would self-harm and wanted me to get medical attention. He doesn't speak English well and isn't very familiar with the American system so he really did over-react in this situation. The problem is, he told the operator  \"I was hitting him.\" According to him, he said this so that the police would arrive faster. When the police arrived, he clarified to the police that there was no physical contact but they were still adamant that some sort of assault had taken place. When asked to identify himself to me, he said \"boyfriend.\" Again, he doesn't speak English well and in his native language, boyfriend = friend who is a boy. \n\nDuring this whole ordeal, I was kept in the car. Every time I tried to step out, the police officer screamed at me. I was crying the entire time. When they asked me if he was my boyfriend, I said no and tried to explain that my friend doesn't speak English. I was under the assumption they were going to take me to the hospital.  I've had a lot of friends who were taken to a hospital who were also called 911 on for mental-health-related crises so I pleaded with the officers that I'm just a stressed college student and that venting about your stress is normal (isn' it?) But the officer handcuffed me anyway and put me in the police cruiser. He was screaming at me the entire time that I had committed a crime. The officer booked me at the station and kept me overnight. \n\nI got an attorney who clarified everything in court. My attorney established that we were just friends, that he had called the police for a mental health crisis, and that there was no physical contact. Most attorneys who have looked at this case agree that the officers overreacted. In my state, domestic violence is taken very seriously, so if a police officer has even the smallest of suspicion, they have the right to arrest and charge you. \n\nThe arrest was very traumatic and I struggled to get back to normal. I was mentally in a low place for a long time. It's painful to have your rights taken from you so abruptly and to be accused of something. I am fortunate that my university supported me throughout this ordeal and I'm safe and healthy now. But I can't help but feel that this situation could have been clarified if the police had done more investigating or had more training on responding to mental health-related crises.

            "selftext": "\n\nOk, this is going to be long but please bear with me. There is a lot to go over here. I have nothing on my criminal record so I have literally no experience at all in court.\n\nI had an on again, off again romantic relationship with a woman whom I later discovered was not at all who she presented herself to be. She has Borderline Personality Disorder, is a compulsive liar, is extremely manipulative, self harms, etc. All of this background info will become relevant as the events unfold.\n\nI found out that she was cheating on me and lying about basically everything, and carrying on sexual chats and exchanging sexually graphic pictures after she attempted suicide in my home while I was sleeping. I woke up, and she was babbling nonsense. She handed me her phone (I'm not sure why) but I looked in it for clues as to why she may be acting the way she was acting. I then found out after going through her phone trying to figure out what was going on that she was cheating, lying about everything, etc. Later, I found it that she was incoherently backing because she had attempted to overdose, while I was asleep. She then blamed the attempt on me, but immediately retracted that because she knew it was fucked up.\n\nFast forward a bit, she is at my home and I decided that she needed to go. I asked her to leave, and opened the door for her to exit. She didn't want to leave, and this turned into a shouting match, which eventually led to her pepper spraying me, and me pepper spraying her. Then we were both lying on the floor blinded and having trouble breathing. After the pepper spray wore off, we went to bed because it was obvious that we just needed to go to bed. We went to bed, woke up the next morning and went to work.\n\nApparently, that day at work she self inflicted some scratches and bruises on herself. She came over again that night, and we were watching TV when the cops knocked on the door. She had a friend call the police, this was a planned thing. She showed the police the self inflicted scratches and bruises, and I was arrested for second degree assault. She got an interim protective order during the time that I was out in the police car and I was served it shortly after I got to jail.\n\nOn the form for the protective order in addition to saying that I had choked her and slapped her, she had put MY ADDRESS as her place of residence! The police GAVE HER MY KEYS while I was in the police cruiser outside. So, I am not allowed in my own house at the moment, while she is staying in my home and has access to all of my things. She came over a lot for sex, but she DID NOT live there in any way.\n\nWhen I got out of jail on my own recognizance, I immediately went to the court and filed my own interim protective order against her. The court date for both is on Monday, and they will likely be heard both at once. I have a copy of my lease showing that she is not living in the home.\n\nNow, on top of all of this, I am being charged with second degree assault by the state, and I will probably also have charges brought against me, by her.\n\nI need to know what I can expect and how best too come up with a defense strategy. She has a criminal history of electronic harassment, has no contact with her parents because of her psychological issues and her children are with their father for the same reasons. She has self inflicted scars several places on her body.\n\nI am REALLY freaking out about this, because she has the possibility of ruining my entire future with this falsification.\n\nDoes anyone have a relative idea what I can expect at court on Monday when we both petition for protective orders? 111",

            "selftext": "My mother got an offer to take over the mortgage payments of a home owned by a family friend who was renting it out. Said party was in an urgent bind to offload this house because of financial and personal health struggles. Unfortunately, my mother agreed to pay them some amount and transfer the title of the home to us. We are wondering what our options are to either transfer the title back to them or how to best proceed with any financial payments to the existing mortgage and previous home owner.\n\nHaving rented all our lives, my mother and I were ill equipped with how to figure out if this was a deal worth going for. Despite the many red flags, my mom saw this as her first real chance of being a homeowner because of her immigration status that makes her ineligible for bank loans. Despite advice to do a home inspection and time to do more research about the process, my mother and I  met with the home owner, a lawyer, and all of a sudden had a general warranty deed paperwork placed in front of us. Some typos needed to be fixed but they ended up calling my mom to finalize the paperwork and submit it to the city. Before the call she received to submit, I was about to prepare to tell my mom that this was not a good deal and we lacked basic information about the property and mortgage.\n\nWe still don\u2019t even have access to the mortgage online account, and my mom has only paid 40% of the amount she had said she\u2019s give to the previous owner. The previous home owner gave my mom one paper mortgage statement after the title paperwork was sent to the city which confirmed the mortgage payment (showing what appears to be the absolute minimal principal being paid off up to this point).\n\nAlthough my mom had seen the house before and knew it would need some repairs, the latest tenants that vacated the property left the house in need of major repairs. The home owners of course pressured me to not do a home inspection before agreeing to transfer the title because they knew it wouldn\u2019t pass. They said after renovations, the home could sell closer to the neighborhood median value. \n\nCurrently, the mortgage is under the previous home owners name. We know significant improvements would need to occur before this house could get refinanced under my name should I try to get a home loan. That was one option I thought of since my credit score is better than that of the previous home owners based on the 6% interest rate (again basic info disclosed to us only after being presented with the title transfer paperwork).  \n\nI told my mom the house needs too many costly repairs and that the money she had agreed to give the owner would be a waste and unfair given the state of the house. They also never signed a contract so I told her she is not under any legal obligation to give them the money. That $10K amount was obviously not based in the worth of the house (appraised at $74K with $72K left to pay off) and is just not a fair deal for us.\n\nI have advised my mom that we need to explore options to give back the title. Is there any process for us to do that and what would that look like? I have told my mom If they keep the $ already given to them and we pay for whatever paperwork, that may be our best option to consider.\n\nIf we can\u2019t reverse course and given that there was no signed contract, outside of angering the other party, are we legally OK to not pay them anything? It seems that we\u2019d have to continue making mortgage payments in their name for the time being and I am curious about any repercussions I should be aware of.\n\nAny input appreciated.",

            "selftext": "What I\u2019m about to tell you is going to be extremely against the law or perfectly acceptable and this is why I\u2019m posting this- to find out if this was even legal and if I should proceed with legal action regarding my landlord and ex-roommate/cousin. So please be prepared. FYI I\u2019m 20, and my cousin/ex-roommate is 29.\n\nHere is the gist: My roommate and I (I am a co-tenant) signed a lease and joint agreement for an apartment back in 08/19 in Oregon, which FYI my roommate is my cousin from Cali. We were doing awesome and had no problem with rent, however, I knew my cousin struggled financially due to starting a \u201cbusiness\u201d. During the middle of Jan. she stated that she talked to our landlord and told me she was thinking about ending the lease because she was prepared to move back to Cali for more opportunities. She told me she discussed this already with the landlord and that our move out date would be 1/20/20 if I agreed to moving out as well, I told her I was okay with it even though I was just beginning classes at my college and now I\u2019d have to drive 40 mins away to college now. But I was okay with it. During the time of us preparing to move out, which we only had two-weeks when she told me, this should have already been my red flag because apartments almost always require you to give a 1-2 month move-out notice but she assured me \u201cno no, I\u2019ve already talked to the landlord and she had approve us to leave\u201d. I decided to move-out 1/18 and even had my parents helping me load all my things. Our landlord even came by and my parents introduced themselves. So here we are, packing up, looking happy and not even disturbed- I bet even she was confused with what she already knew about our situation- or rather, my cousin\u2019s. She just smiled and wished us luck. So now it is February, I\u2019m moved out and my cousin is happy and jolly in California and we still were talking and having a great relationship. Until the 25th of Feb. rolls by and I received a debt collection payment in the mail, I opened it and saw that the creditor was from our apartment complex with a payment of $2500 due within 30 days. I called the company and they told me we didn\u2019t pay rent + utilities from Dec- Jan. I said there is mistake and he said no mam, there isn\u2019t and you guys did not pay the termination fee for your lease. I told him he was mistaken because my roommate assured me she paid because it was her idea to cancel the lease and she discussed this with the landlord. He said no mam, you guys did not pay, in fact, you guys were evicted. So once he stated this then I proceeded to tell him I am going to get answers from the landlord and find out of this is true, he was getting upset and requested my account for payment. So I hung up. This was absolutely shocking because I was sure this was a mistake or even fraud/scam. I sent a picture to my roommate and even told her my suspicions of fraud and not to act on anything until we get more answers, she sent me texts indicating she had no idea what was going on either and that she will call the company. She even told me through text \u201cbut I paid everything.\u201d I told her I think we should call each other and our landlord to find out just what happened and confirm that this is fraud and just a scam. My second red flag- once I mentioned calling the landlord in our last texts and I said that we should call her in the morning- I never received a response from her. The next morning rolls by, I called my landlord and she did 100% confirm that these facts were true- when I found out I was on the verge of actually throwing up due to the facts and emotional shock. She told me that my roommate never turned in rent for Dec. and that she was assuring our landlord she would have the money, so during the time our rent was due- she did not pay. During the leeway time of turning in late rent- she did not pay. In fact, I was in AZ visiting family and I sent a cash app upon my roommate\u2019s request for my half- so I did for $675. Basically my roommate kept the money and never turned in my portion. So we didn\u2019t pay for utilities + rent- however, i paid half our electric bill separately and I have been able to pay for my half the entirety of up until our lease was cancelled through an agreement that I will get to later. So my landlord proceeded to tell me she filed for an eviction over the phone and they posted on our door on 12/08 a 72-hour notice- I was not at my apartment until I got back from AZ and spent most of my time at home in WA during Dec. because my roommate and I had an argument that turned into us not talking for 2 1/2 weeks, during the entirety of our eviction notices throughout the month of December, I had no idea this process was going on. And yes- I did not even receive one verbal or written notice myself from my landlord- not even an email or phone call. \n\nSo then my landlord told me over the phone that she then filed for an eviction and made a case against us for not paying rent, so we received a letter in the mail 12/28 telling us that we had a court date/ summoning on 1/14/20. My cousin told me around 1/08/20 about wanting to move out and that all we needed to do was turn in our last month\u2019s of rent along with the termination fee, so I got a check from my bank for last month\u2019s of rent and turned it in. On 1/14 when I was back home and my roommate and I were back on good terms after spending and celebrating the holidays together (because remember my ex-roommate is my cousin) with my family, she told me the day prior of 1/14 that she was going to go to Powell\u2019s bookstore on 1/14 in downtown Portland to put happy notes in the books for when people grab a book and open it and find a happy note- of course I said have fun with that and she left the next morning early. Little did I know, she was actually going to court to sign an agreement for us to vacate the premises 1/20 or what she calls \u201cfighting for the apartment\u201d, how can you fight for an apartment that you knew wasn\u2019t getting paid for? During this whole time- not once did my landlord approach me regarding this whole matter for 2 WHOLE months and inform me, but she didn\u2019t even inform me about a court case, meanwhile my roommate was withholding these notices from me?!? Is that even legal?? My landlord proceeded to tell me that it was perfectly legal for my roommate to sign on my behalf for this court case? That can\u2019t be legal, because when my landlord sent me the court records through email recently- I read in the court paper that was for the agreement of vacating on 1/20/20 it stated that \u201cthe following terms should apply in all cases\u201d then it states \u201cany defendant signing this agreement expressly represents that he/she is the authorized agent acting for and on behalf of any other named defendant(s) and any/all other occupants, as well as by signing this agreement, the parties acknowledge the complete understanding of the terms and conditions herein.\u201d I can tell you one thing, I never once agreed to this or my roommate having my permission/authorization. Is this legal? My landlord said that my roommate was within her legal rights for signing on my behalf and her showing up to court without me is permissible. Again, how is that legal if I had notices withheld from me without my knowledge and I never once received a written or verbal notice from my landlord or the management company? Or my roommate? So in essence, we could have had this eviction not on our records if my roommate would have told me this was happening and that if we would have paid the $2500 by 2/20/20, then this wouldn\u2019t technically affect our credit nor would we both have an eviction record. I do want to mention one last detail regarding the rent I turned in for January, since the payment for Jan. was partial rent (obviously since my roommate STILL didn\u2019t have any money) she didn\u2019t accept my payment, but rather than handing my check/payment to me personally...she gave it to my roommate?? Again, HOW IS THIS LEGAL?? How is it legal for me to have not even once been notified that we were getting evicted, and for a roommate to withhold legal eviction notices from the other co-tenant, then for her to sign on my behalf to an agreement to vacate. My suspicion since my roommate did often talk and visit with our landlord is that my landlord walked her through the process and told her that just accepting to vacate in court would be our best chances of #1 canceling the lease #2 going about the least cost effective method of getting out of our situation. If we would have paid to actually cancel our lease and then our last portion of rent, we would have paid a total of approx. $4000 dollars which is what I thought happened, but actually the complete opposite happened. I think my cousin/roommate really tried to opt for the cheapest option and my landlord helped her with the process. And this is why I feel this is completely illegal and that I certainly without a doubt got cheated. As for now, my ex-roommate/cousin is quite aware of what she has done and has been called out. She told me she was sent me back the checks (December\u2019s rent which she ended up turning my cash app into a money gram because apparently she tried to also turn that in for rent but my landlord of course gave it back because it\u2019s partial, then she has my check for Jan. addressed to our apartments which she can\u2019t of course put in her account, but all in all, she has been holding my checks and never even told me, then proceeded to head back down to Cali with them?? This has been an absolute betrayal of trust and our relationship and she is quite aware.) I\u2019m waiting for them to get mailed back, but I\u2019ll find out once again if she has also lied about sending them- cause I\u2019ll wait to see if they even show up or not. \n\nWhat I should have done was been more attentive and trusted my gut, I should have actually gone and talked to my landlord when I had my first red flag and even when my parents asked me \u201care you sure she paid?\u201d But I did go back and ask her and this was a topic of discussion with my roommate where she did verify she did pay the lease off at the very least 3 times. To all of you who are iffy about getting into a lease with someone, trust that feeling. Because whether we think it\u2019s true or not, sometimes it really be the people you closest to, that are willing to hurt and cheat you. Please beware of ever being in a situation like I\u2019m finding myself in right now. And for any of those who might have any inkling as to whether the actions my ex-roommate and landlord undertook where illegal, I truly would appreciate any help or advice on this situation regarding anything legal/illegal. Should I proceed with any legal actions and do I have enough evidence. If you all need anymore information provided, I\u2019m happy to do so for this situation. Can I fight this eviction off my record? Is it too late? Thank you.",

The boss acted like this was negotiable and promised a 3-month and 6-month evaluation for a raise. These never happened.\n\nb) Several times her timesheet has been messed up and her boss has calculated the wrong hours. Thankfully, my sister keeps track of her hours and independently so this is occasionally fixed, but not always. They also do not pay overtime.\n\nc) The boss schedules unpaid, mandatory meetings without asking the employees to set their availability beforehand.\n\nd) The other day my sister was asked to participate in some advertising because of her latte art. Another co-worker expressed to her boss that they should be additionally compensated for this type of performance, as they were being professionally photographed and everything. The boss then called my sister and said something to the extent of, \"Hey such and such co-worker isn't demonstrating the right attitude of the business\" to which my sister responded that she agreed with the coworker. The boss said that she did not ask for my sister's opinion and she just wanted to know whether my sister could do this for her (for free, of course). I feel like I can't be legal to talk to an employee this way.\n\nAnyways, what legal repercussions can my sister take, if any. This is in NYC by the way.",

I\u2019m four weeks into my full time job after graduating and I decided I wanted to treat myself! I booked an appointment a week and a half ago to have eyelash extensions put on\u2014something to just make me feel a little more confident. I scheduled the appointment for yesterday (Saturday 2/29) with a seemingly reputable girl who has a large following and has catered to a few people I know. I put down a $25 deposit through apple pay to secure my appointment.\n\nYesterday I headed to the salon that she rents a booth out of\u2014which is thirty minutes away\u2014and texted her to make sure I was at the right place once I arrived to which she responded that she had an emergency and wasn\u2019t going to be in today. I found it irritating she wouldn\u2019t let me know beforehand so that I didn\u2019t waste my time and gas, but was sympathetic and offered my condolences. She offered to make time for me either that night, the next day (today, Sunday) or Monday. I said that would be great. No response.\n\nTexted her again, no response. Texted her a third time last night and she responded saying we could do Monday. I said I work full time and no week days work for me. I then politely asked for my deposit back. No response.\n\nFast forward to this morning: I texted her asking what the deal was and she said she could fit me in Monday, although I already made it clear that wouldn\u2019t work. At this point I just want my money back and texted her a lengthy message explaining how the service was never preformed and I want my money back. I\u2019m paying off student loans and trying to support myself with an entry level job\u2014$25 is a lot for me honestly. She has been ignoring my texts and I\u2019m afraid I won\u2019t get my money back. I can\u2019t believe she is being so unprofessional and I\u2019m upset this is happening.\n\nI know this may seem laughable or minuscule compare to other similar scenarios, but how should I go about this? If I go to the salon where she rents booth, are they legally responsible for her? Would that make a difference if I went up there? Will my bank dispute the charges? \n\nLegally speaking, how should I go about this? I\u2019m not sure what to do. Any advice is appreciated!",

Since then, my pay has been docked because they started scrutinizing over minutes and now they are implementing new rules that will extend my by 30 minutes. This has been a very frustrating and stressful issue for me so I'm reaching out to see what other people think.\n\n-The supervisor who processed my time card misunderstood my shift (7:30-4:30) and assumed I was 8-5, so I lost 0.5 per shift because they thought I was leaving early. I never received the time they miscalculated even after I explained in detail. Supervisors are avoidant.\n\n-This happened again the next pay period and all of my coworkers came up short that check because of minutes after their starting time. But the time spent coming in early to work on something or staying a little late because procedures/surgeries- disregarded. The only time that will be documented is our official start time to our end time. I have not since been in a position where I had a surgery that ran late, but I have left 20-30 min after 5 and it went unpaid. \n\n-Now they have a new rule; lunches are no longer hour paid, but half hour unpaid and we are required to make up that time at the end of the shift because their contract with the institution requires 8 hours of work. I asked about what happens if I'm always in surgery at that time and was told \"they are still working on that\" So we were all handed a sheet to sign with this new information. I did not sign and nobody has contacted me about it yet. \n*sketchy notes from the sheet* \n-The sheet says all employees will be required to be on-site 8.5 hours Monday through Friday (My schedule is 9 hours Monday through Thursday and 4 hours on Sunday)\n-Lunch is required to take from 11am-1pm (I am usually always in a surgery or procedure at this time)\n-Record all hours worked; paid or unpaid (what? unpaid work?)\n-They state that all of this is in accordance to NYS labor law guidelines, but I just have a weird feeling about this. \n\nDoes anything seem off to you?

I don't know quite what happened next but it was along the lines of \"CLEAN THAT UP IF YOU LOVE THE CAT SO MUCH\", I said I will once I calm him down the cat was petrified.\n\n he then charged at me with what can only be described as a psychotic stare bright red and grabbed me by my windpipe and began pushing me towards the glass doors.\n\n I'm recovering from major surgery I had in early jan, but the year before I was working out lifting weights 3-4 times a week and had put on 2-3 stone of muscle, so I grabbed his hand from my windpipe and pushed him into a seat and got on top of him to subdue him, he then tried to flip it round so he'd be on top of me, simple bjj sweep had me in full mount when he then punched me(lol) from the ground.\n I put my knee on his arm to stop any further strikes and told him \"no more bullying for you are you stupid?\". at this point my younger brothers who are equally as much of a set of pricks, jumped on my back, me the person who was being assaulted and proceeded to try and choke me out, the pain was unbearable as my windpipe is damaged. my dad then got on top and punched me again in the face and started nonsense saying im not sick im just lazy(I can assure you im quite sick, you can't fake blood tests). I talked back telling them that three on one was not a good idea for their long term prospects and ill have my two mates here in an instant to hammer the shit out of them, they let go but kept shouting made up lies they've concocted to blame me for they're failures(youngest brother said I ruined his life because I smoked weed in college,hes ten years younger, you getting the drift here, were talking seriously mentally ill people)\n\nthey said then \"kick him out\" over and over and we're calling the police. I called the police, they totally freaked out, my dad then said your out right now. police were here this morning, parents told them to check my room for weed, I let them, they took it, nothing because it was a tiny amount just sitting there. anyway they interviewed me and said \"my da says hes not pressing charges?\" yes you read right,i showed the police my hands everything to indicate I never struck or forcefully touched any one and showed them my neck, my eye had gone down.\n\nthey have now decided im being kicked onto the street, disabled, unable to barley walk flight of stairs or any distance, in extreme debt due to Christmas,mother birthday all at once while I was sick.",

I never call out and there was somebody to cover me so this really shouldn't have been an issue. However, the day I returned I found an attendance policy posted on the wall that was signed by two out of my four managers, that my general manager had put up. \n\nThe attendance policy stated some normal things about immediate termination for no call/no show, but past that it is incredibly shady. \n\nIt states that \"anyone who calls out of their shift without a physicians note or shows up late will be paid minimum wage with NO gratuities (tips) added to their paycheck for that pay period.\"\n\nAddressing the paycheck thing, we work for minimum wage plus tips. We make $9.5 an hour with tips. The regular minimum wage is higher (11.5). When I confronted my manager he told me that he was referring to the 9.5 tipped wage in the policy, and that he would remove all tips. Call me out if I'm wrong but I'm pretty sure this is highly illegal. You cannot remove a workers tips if you're not making up for the difference, also all of that tip money would be going directly to him.

I tried to explain it best I could because I\u2019m in desperate need for any advice. \n\nMy younger brothers both dropped out of school about 2 years ago. I (f19) have no idea where to start to efficiently help. One stopped going to a public school when he was 13 (15 now), but he tried doing homeschool for a bit (give or take 6 months) until my mother just completely gave up on him. He has dyslexia and she doesn\u2019t know how to deal with it, so she was doing the homeschool work for him. I was unaware of this until recently, but my father somehow knew. She got caught by the supervisor who comes and checks on my brother\u2019s progress. My mother soon stopped teaching my brother and making appointments to have people come over to check on my brother\u2019s progress. Now all my brother does is play video games and sleep in. He stopped going to public school because of all the bullying by the teachers. He would come home angry and upset often. One teacher told him that he could never amount to anything. He wouldn\u2019t want to talk about his bad day, so no one ever knew he needed help.\n\nMy other brother has a different, yet similar, situation. He (now 17) stopped going to his public high school when he was a sophomore (just turned 16). He should be finishing up junior year now. When he stopped going, it wasn\u2019t out of the blue. He could barely go a full week, yet even a full day, to school. He would simply say that he doesn\u2019t want to be there anymore and he wants to go home. I think he has depression, but I have absolutely no idea how to handle it because all I can think of when I see both of them is that they are not going to school. We live in a nice neighborhood in a rather safe small town. There\u2019s no excuse for them to be dropouts because I know for a fact that people dropout for much more important reasons. \n\nMy parents do not care at all. My father is working, so he doesn\u2019t want to deal with it. My mother is an extremely difficult person to reason with. Her behavior gets extreme when someone disagrees with her. She yells and threatens to kill herself/leave. On top of that, my parents are getting a divorce within a year. My brothers do not know, but when they find out, it\u2019s going to send them in a spiral. I think this because our mother cheated on our dad for the past 8 years. Yes, she still does it to this day. I just want them to kind of have their lives together before that happens. I have no idea how they are going to get a divorce because my mom refuses to believe it/doesn\u2019t want to talk about it with my father and they are breaking the law with my brothers\u2019 situation. \n\nWe live in California and the legal dropout age is 18 without guardian permission and 16 with guardian permission. The process works like so (from limited research): the school calls, arranges a meeting with guardian and kid, and figures out a plan for their education. If the kid fails the plan, the guardians have to pay $100 fine and the fine goes up every time they don\u2019t go to school. I\u2019m not sure if I explained this well so my apologies and I\u2019m not sure if my information is correct for my specific situation. We are just so far past that, I think it\u2019s worse than I think it is. I do know that what my parents are doing is against the law and will result in a fine. I do know that my youngest brother\u2019s (15) school called to arrange that meeting and my mother ignored those calls. \n\nOf course I\u2019ve tried to step up and help. I stopped because my brothers are already difficult to deal with. They are mean and are determined to never set foot on a school campus ever again. That\u2019s why we want them to at least get their GED. That\u2019s the somewhat plan. My parents yell and scream at each other all the time about other things and my brothers. My parents do not efficiently help them, whenever we talk about it my parents fight with each other until someone throws something at the other. They cannot work together, not even for their kids. They yell at me for trying to take my brothers\u2019 situation as my responsibility because all they do is fight about it. They do not like it when I tell them that what they are doing is wrong and they need to help their kids. I just want them to push through because I cannot do this by myself.\n\nWhen my brothers first dropped out of school, I ignored it because I thought my parents had it under control and it was temporary. I admit that this is a fault on my part because now it is worse. I have no idea how to start or where to start to get my brothers to at least do their GED without having to raise my parents in the process. Advice?\n\nAlso, my parents would kill me if I ever went to another family member about my brothers. \nI hope this all makes sense because it is a lot and I\u2019m sure I forgot important information.",

Fast forward to the incident I was close to home though, so  ( maybe 4 mins away ) and I was in the middle lane of some moderate traffic. Now, this is near midnight and I will admit, with midterms this week I hadn't slept in about 73 hours. Some lights begin flashing behind me and I think it is an ambulance or fire truck but there was no sound or anything so I didn't know what to think of that. I try to leave the lane turning left, but I couldn't because of the big traffic I didn't feel like I could navigate out of the traffic immediately so I just took a turn that leads me off the road in front of my house.   \n\n\nWhen I stopped my car ( before I could even park ) 5-6 police officers come out of nowhere and wouldn't let me park. Turns out that ambulance was a series of police cars.  Apparently, that rock had damaged my backlight for my license plate. It broke one of the 2 bulbs so it looked dim. They just asked me some basic questions that I think were to test if I was intoxicated ( which I've never drunk) but I was also very exhausted but answered all questions to the best of my ability. But I guess I may have been slow.   \n\n\nThey gave me news saying I wasn't in trouble but they needed to talk to me in the station quickly and I could be back soon. When I got out of my car they told me I was under arrest for fleeing the police (class B demeanor)  because I didn't pull over quickly enough. Literally. Word for word, I read it on their report. \n\nThe ordeal took 6 mins and I have my phone screen recording of me using google maps to prove the time stamp. Can I fight this? I bought my own Bail because I needed to get to school soon. Like, what would I need to do to get this removed from my record because honestly, I think it is ridiculous. We were in a high traffic area and I didn't feel comfortable pulling over on the road. But now I have a criminal record which will hurt my chances for insurance and a JOB in the future.   \n\n\nCan I do anything? Prepare anything? I can't afford a lawyer so I'm thinking public defendant?",

The car I bought is not from their brand make. The car was practically new because it had less than 5,500 miles and still had the manufacturer's warranty on it. I purchased it and drove it for a good two months until it randomly stopped working one day. \n\nI had my car towed to its Brand-(B) service department. Based on the first observation, they suspect that an aftermarket alarmed was installed and was removed improperly. They explained that if it were the case, the car could just stop working at any time. Similar to a Killswitch alarm effect. I had no idea that there was an aftermarket part installed, and then removed, prior to purchasing the car. The Brand-(B) service department pointed out two drilled holes under my steering wheel, where the aftermarket alarmed was. It's not very noticeable unless you looked for it. However, they were not sure if that was what caused the car to stop working. So I had to leave my car there for them to diagnose the issue. \n\nI notified Brand-(A) dealership. A representative called me back. The Rep\u2019s response at first was that they didn't remove any alarm based on their service records, and they never knew there was an aftermarket part that was installed prior. That information doesn't seem to help me. I asked Rep if they will pay for the repair fee if it was due to an aftermarket part considering it was not disclosed to me before I had purchased the car from them. They declined to do so, but after I explained to them this is not fair because I just bought the car that was supposed to be practically new with the manufacturer's warranty on it and I only drove it for 2 months. Rep asked me to send them the report once the service department finished diagnosing.\n\nA month later and the service department finally determined that it was the fault of an improper installation/removal of an aftermarket alarm. In addition to the drill holes by the steering wheel, there was tampering with the cars wiring. It had affected the ECU and other technical things I wasn't familiar with. So because of that, the Brand-(B)\u2019s warranty will not cover it. The price to repair and replace is quite.....expensive. I believe the severity of the damage to the car and the fact that it does not work, is something I should not pay for. \n\nI immediately emailed and left a voicemail to Rep at Brand-(A) dealership. I've yet to receive any emails or call back the next day. Frustrated and stress about this situation, I decided to go to Brand-(A) dealership to find a resolution to this. But before doing so, I stopped by Brand-(B) service department and took photos of the areas of the tampered wires. The technician had even discovered a cable that was left inside the dash that belonged to an aftermarket alarm, and it somehow was still attached to the ECU/modules. \n\nOnce I reached Brand-(A) dealership, Rep was not working that day. I ended up talking to a sales manager and the responses were not helpful in resolving this situation. The manager doesn't believe they should be paying the fee, claiming they didn't know there was an aftermarket part in the car. I asked the manager, Do you not check the cars thoroughly before selling? The manager confidently said yes, we do. In my response I asked Why is there an aftermarket cable left inside my car? No response. The manager directed me to talk with Rep the following Monday and see how it can be resolved. \n\nI'm worried that if the conversation doesn't work out in my favor, I will have to settle this through court. I've looked at the Lemon Law for California and it doesn't seem to work in my situation because of the aftermarket alarm.\n\nI bought the car for a fair value with the idea of it being great mileage, clean record, still under warranty. Only to end up with a vehicle that will not start 2 months later, and still making payments on it.\n\nThe dealership should have done a though inspection and known or should have know; base on how apparent the drill holes were, that there was an alarm installed. And that the excesses wire still attached to the ECU meant that there was wire tampering and improper removal of the alarm that will cause the car to shut down in the future. This information greatly impacts the function and value of this car, information that was not disclosed to me before purchasing the car. \n\nWould this be a case that would be in my favor?",

I am very scared for my life. \nHi I\u2019m having a very life threatening situation in Virgniabthat is not being taken seriously. My brother is on heavy drugs and was recently released from a mental hospital that he was committed to involuntarily. He was taken in because he was destroying the house in which we live and was refusing to cooperate with cops saying he was going to kill him self. After being released he\u2019s kept up the heavy drug use and raging. Things finally exploded four nights ago when he kicked in my door and stole from me. He proceeded to go to his room and pass out. My parents let themselves into the room to find he was passed out and unresponsive. They tried waking him and after several attempts had to dial 911. Police and paramedics showed up and couldn\u2019t get him to respond for five minutes. He finally awoke angry and raging being out under arrest. They took him to a local hospital to have him checked out. He was released within under an hour and was back in the house destroying property and beating our family dog to the point I didn\u2019t think the dog was alive. He went into my parents room and flipped their furniture. He then busted into my room, bruising my girlfriend  my  and threatened me several times while I had 911 dispatcher on phone. For 30 seconds they could hear him screaming and making threats. He even pointed a gun  with a laser sight into my room. Upon realizing I was calling the police he fled the house screaming \u201cI wish I had a bullet for every single one of you. The police took 15 minutes to arrive after the horrifying phone call. My parents were at the magistrates office trying to get a protective order, of which they were denied for \u201cnot being credible\u201d. After getting out of the house the police finally arrived and said unless we could prove it was him there was nothing the police could do. He called my mom while police were in the house saying he was across the road watching asking when cops were leaving so he could get his pot and stash of drug. My girlfriend and I retreated from the property to her grandparents to remove ourselves from the toxic situation, but he again followed us here and texted me telling me he saw the car in the driveway. My girlfriend and I go to the magistrate to get a protective order and they grant her one. The police picked him up after he the issue was served to him, but released on bad paperwork on the magistrates side.Not even 24 hours later he breaks the protective order by texting her phone obscenities. We go down the the magistrates office yet again, and it\u2019s a different woman. She told the magistrate he broke the protective order. Instead of addressing the issue at hand she kept insisting she could smell alcohol on my girl friends breath. She said they\u2019d file it but it would take months and basically laughed us out of the police station. Now I\u2019m getting texts messages from my brothers friends harassing me.

I have no money for an attorney. \n\nThe accusation is regarding an allegation of substance abuse, there are no allegetions of negligence or patient harm. \n\nI agreed to an interim suspended license during the investigation so I am not practicing medicine nor could I if I wanted to. They drag their heels with their investigation but I don\u2019t complain. \n\nAt the end of 2019 I agreed to undergo an evaluation by one of their doctors, this was mandated to happen within 30 days, over 60 days passed before it happened. The evaluator who actually said  to me \u201cno one is questioning your clinical ability\u201d decided that I am not safe to practice due to a substance use disorder (of note I have not been given one single drug test this entire time). Once that came in they amended the complaint and took settlement off the table. \n\nI told the DAG from the beginning I would do \u201cabsolutely anything the board would like so that they feel comfortable with me keeping my license- drug testing, diversion program, anything at all\u201d, when she told me my choices were hearing or voluntary surrender of my license I asked for time to cash out my pension and retain counsel, she agreed. \n\nTwo weeks ago I received an email from a different DAG, the one I had been working with is gone and she\u2019s taking over and she \u201cneeds to set the matter for hearing\u201d. So, essentially, I gave them all the time they wanted to go on their witch hunt and now is super urgent they schedule. I totally fucked myself by once again foolishly believing if I stay the course and tell the truth things will work out- when will I learn weasels don\u2019t care? \n\nWe go back and forth for a while as I explain the situation, try to catch her up on all the things I had discussed with her predecessor but no dice. I argue the only potential harm in waiting is to me as I am not practicing but that seems irrelevant to her. She actually sent me an email saying it was my \u201clast chance\u201d to tell her what days in May I would be available. \n\nI requested she point me to the laws or codes that say she cannot wait to schedule. I ask her what recourse I have if she insists on scheduling against my requests, she doesn\u2019t answer but continues to threaten. I finally say \u201cif you insist on setting the matter please requests for July or later, I don\u2019t think I am available in May or June\u201d. She emailed me that she \u201ctold them that your preference was July but that I am available before then, it will be up to the OAH\u201d. I received a letter that the hearing is set for June 1, that doesn\u2019t sit right with me so I request a copy of what she sent them in making her request. \n\nWhat I [received](https://imgur.com/a/vHR543V) revealed that not only had she not said what she told me but that she specifically requested 3 sets of dates all before July. \n\nI called the OAH and they told me to write a letter to the judge explaining why I can\u2019t go the date she requested and to CC the DAG. My problem is I technically can go that date I just don\u2019t know when I will have an attorney or how much time they will need to prepare my defense. \n\nMy question\u2019s are these: 1) what recourse do I have about the hearing date and 2) against her for bullying and lying to me\n\nI straight up told her that she was pressuring me and i felt I was being taken advantage of because I don\u2019t yet have counsel. \n\nOf note: it will be ~2-4 more weeks until I have the money from my pension to retain counsel. \n\nMy bigger but not as pressing question (I can wait until I have a lawyer) is why/how can they say my only options are surrender or hearing when I\u2019m saying I\u2019m\nwilling to agree to any sort of rehabilitation or other treatment or monitoring - I thought they were not supposed to be punitive on the topic of substance abuse. \n\nThank you in advance for any help. This has ruined my life and I\u2019m really grasping at straws to keep moving forward.\n\nTl;dr: I waived my right to a speedy hearing in exchange for a settlement.

When he did come he was rude and only talked (no one ever came to make physical repairs). February 15 I was out with my toddler and baby while my husband was at home to meet the contractor. They got into a disagreement so my husband called the police. The landlord texted me saying everybody is getting removed (including my children) from the home right away. After things calmed down, he said we could stay and he\u2019d address safety concerns only if my husband was off the lease. We didn\u2019t agree so he is now evicting us. His argument is that we broke the lease by not permitting repairs. \n\nMy question is about my defense. The house was vacant for over a month after we paid the deposit and rent.

So in July of 2018 I was involved in a head on collision, a woman crossed the yellow line hit my Jeep, I was going the speed limit, 55 mph she was going slightly above. She admitted fault, she did not have car insurance, a valid drivers license and was texting at the time of the accident, however this happened in a small rural community and this woman has known mental illness and is constantly being picked up by the local authorities no additional charges were filed besides driving left to center. Fortunately, the owner of the car who loaned the woman the Charger has an insurance it was a 300,000 max line for all parties involved in the accident. The injuries accrued from this accident for myself and my spouse have been fairly signifiant and expensive nearing the policy limit. \n\nBoth of us were taken to the local ER  in a very rural town via EMS. There we were triaged I received x-rays showing 2 fractured ribs and my shoulder was also imaged and placed in a sling and I was set up with a ortho appointment. \n\nMy husband was placed in a neck stabilizer and then had a CT scan, he was diagnosed with a concussion and we were both sent home. \n\nA day and a half later we end up at the local trauma center, he is slurring words unable to form complete sentences, and had a mildly dilated pupil which resulted in another CT scan and an MRI, hew was diagnosed with a severe concussion and sent through 6 weeks on concussion PT therapy and over a neuropsychologist due to the side effects that are still lingering a year later and is still needing treatment due to the memory issues, migraines, dizziness, etc. and is looking at life long medication management now. He missed a total of 4 weeks of work. \n\nI in additional to the 2 fractured ribs, went to an orthopedic specialist I also received an CT, and MRI, my left shoulder had a complete librium tear, the bicep was shredded, and the head of the ball and socked was fractured and a torn rotator cuff. I required a complete left shoulder reconstruction, I was lucky that the ball and socket was able to be repaired, sparing a total joint replacement at 33. Due to the severity of the ribs, surgery was on hold for 6 weeks to decrease the risk of pneumonia. I am a nurse in a busy CCU and could not work in that 6 week period, my time off work equaled 6.5 months off and extensive physical therapy. My range of motion returned to only 85% and I now have arthritis, some nerve damage was recorded on the EMG, I do have intermittent arm numbness, and there is an increased risk of me needing a full replacement when I'm older.\n\nI was fortunate enough working in healthcare to have amazing insurance, however this accident still took a toll on us finically with lost wages and out of pocket expenses for deductibles and co-pays and traveling to physicians and we will have to pay back med-pay for State Farm, and my husband is continuing care. I know we are already nearing the 300,000 mark of their policy (my surgery with therapy came to 180,000). \n\nI was just wondering what our options were if the 300,000 to low, and thats all their policy max was if there was any other options or if I should just be happy with that. I feel like our case is just so minimal and child's play for our attorney that and I just wanted to get a second opinion before we started the negotiation with their insurance to make sure I'm going into this with our best interest in mind, because I know this isn't going to be a million dollar big money case for him. \n\nThanks!!",

At the time of her passing it had a balance of around $5,000 USD. It took some time for me to compile the needed documents as my family is not the easiest to work with and now that I have access to the account, I can see that the balance is around $1k. This is due to some recurring debit card transactions, two of which are charitable contributions and one of which is a bill payment for a home security system. More confusingly, there is also a huge payment of exactly $2,500 made to a TJ Maxx store credit card more than 2 months after her passing. I absolutely would not put it above my mother or some other family members to have made some sort of unscrupulous payment from my grandmother's account. \n\nI understand that creditors sometimes lie and will still collect on the accounts of the deceased even though there is no legal obligation to pay. If that was the case, do I have any recourse to get this money back? And if the account paid to was not actually belonging to my grandmother, is that a matter for which I'd have to file a police report and sue the offending family member for damages? I would also like to recuperate the money paid to the home security company long after her passing. Where do I start? I'm not worried about the charitable contributions and am happy to let those remain in her memory.",

If there any major details that need to be included please let me know in the comments.\n\nI have been a member of this gym since it\u2019s opening, about 7 years ago. Another male, let\u2019s call him Chris, has been at the same gym for the same amount of time. Chris has a history of harassing members at the gym (especially me) most of which has gone undocumented. He uses smelling salts while lifting and frequently falls into a rage in the gym. The incident happened three days ago. He verbally attacked me, which I did not respond to. A short while later I was playing an afternoon basketball game. He shoved me in this game multiple times to none of which I retaliated. After the game, I was celebrating the win with my teammates, when he promptly approached me and hit me in the side of my head with all his strength. I was backpeddling, trying to get away from him as he punched me. I briefly lost consciousness, and when I regained consciousness I did not fight back, but went directly to the manager. This is all documented on camera. I have worked at this gym for more than a year. The manager and her immediate superior tried to convince me not to force them to send the video to corporate, stating that my assailant will not do it again and he has never had another conflict on record. However, I can get at least a dozen people to report on his previous conflicts. Management is not planning on revoking his membership, or issuing any punishment for that matter. Three days ago, I explained that I do not feel safe working there while he continues to be there, and I wish for them to send the tape to higher management in corporate. Today I was supposed to work, but again cited that I will not risk personal injury working there. They are threatening to fire me. \n\nThis whole thing seems crazy to me, how someone can assault another in the gym, walk out with a smile on his face, and receive no consequences.

It's getting worse, not better.\n\nHer cat is not a cuddler, and my roommate seems to willfully ignore this and all body language, then gets upset and punishes the cat when she inevitably lashes out.  She's been told by myself and multiple other people and she refused to listen to reason.\n\nWe got a hand-me-down TV a while ago that is in great condition, despite it's tendency to ocassionally randomly burst into very sudden and loud status until you turn it off and on again.  This startled us and the cat both.  Any time I've been home and this has happened, the cat will run into another room or into the corner of the living room and cower for a moment and I simply fix it and sit down and leave the cat be for a while to calm down.  She never gets aggressive afterward.  My roommate, however, will always immediately rush to the cat and try to pick her up and \"comfort\" her, despite all the clear verbal and body language warnings the cat displays to show distress.  She'll then pick up the cat and lock her in the bedroom for a random period of time to \"calm down\".  I've witnessed this multiple times and always plead with her to just leave the cat alone for a while to calm down, and she always tells me she's just trying to make sure she's okay and ignores me, continuing to get into the cats personal space and cause it to hiss and lash out.\n\nToday, however, has been the worst.  I woke up to the sound of the cat screaming and my roommate yelling at her.  This happened three times before j finally decided I had to intervene.  When I came into the living room I saw the poor cat scrunched up under a table while my roommate held a large blanket over the front of the table to block her in, chastising her loudly as she tried to force herself on the cat.  It took ten minutes of reasoning to get my roommate to begrudgingly drop the blanket and sit down, and I left so the cat could call down.  However, I'm worried the damage is already done.  \n\nWhen I came back out of my room and hour later for lunch my roommate was still on the couch, asking me to preheat the over for her because every time she attempted to get up off the couch and go anywhere, the cat would go on the offensive and try to attack her.  When I came out, the cat immediately ran up to me ( not aggressively ) and rubbed on my leg and my roommate loudly chastised her for it, like it was some personal ploy to make her look bad, as if she hasn't already made herself look bad enough.\n\nThe cat rubbed on my leg, but growled the whole time, so I let her rub while I stood still until she walked away, but she never took her eyes off my roommate and was clearly very on edge.  After a few rounds of this I thought it might be better to try to gently get her to go into the bedroom on her own ( our apartment is small, and with her camping herself in the hallway, neither of us could cross freely without risk of setting her off ).  I sat down and she came up to me and I offered my hand for her to rub, which she did but then immediately lashed out with with both front paws and her teeth.  It was only a quick bite and I didn't react to it, but I knew that something was way more off than normal because she's never lashed out at me before.\n\nI did q little googling and took some tips, grabbing a few favorite toys and patiently playing with her to help work out some of the nervous energy, then managed to gently coax her into the bedroom and calmly closed the door.  My roommate did nothing but watch and mock us the entire time, claiming that she'd tried that ( \"I've tried everything\" ) and refusing to even move while I calm her cat.  She barely apologized for me getting bitten and she's still refusing to listen to my advise.\n\nWhat can I do to get this cat some help?  I'll be moving by the end of the year and I really can't take the cat with me ( not sure it's legal even if I wanted to ) and I'm honestly afraid to leave the cat behind alone with her.  Not to mention, I'm now worried in the meantime that I'll have to deal with more lashing out by a scared cat whose owner doesn't care to meet her ln her level.\n\nAny help and advice is appreciated.",

It has mismatching fences on 3 sides of the yard (one belongs to the apartment building to the south, one belongs to the neighbor to the west, and one divides my yard from the neighbor to the north). It needed a lot of work done, being 120 years old, so we ordered a LARGE dumpster and put it in the side yard to the north, blocking access to the back yard. It was scheduled to be picked up before the new a/c unit arrived but wasn\u2019t because \u201csomeone called and cancelled the pickup\u201d (I think someone at the company fucked up and didn\u2019t want to admit it) so we had to open a hole in part of the fence to fit the unit through behind the dumpster, as the unit was going to be installed behind the house.\n\nCue the neighbor to the north\u2019s daughter throwing an absolute FIT, which included calling the police without even trying to talk to us, because \u201che needs the security of the fence!\u201d Mind you that fence is keeping literally no one out of anyone\u2019s yard, because it\u2019s just a divider and doesn\u2019t enclose either yard at all. \n\nWe haven\u2019t gotten around to fixing a hole in a fence that keeps no one out of anything, because we have more important work to do inside the house. Fast forward a few months and the neighbor dies because he\u2019s in his late 90s, and an older couple buys the house and moves in. This was maybe 9 months ago now. I\u2019ve only talked to the wife a couple times and she seemed fine. \n\nBut TODAY!! My parents are over at the house helping us work, and as my mom is hanging up curtains in the kitchen she spots the wife out in her yard and goes outside to ask her if she\u2019d mind if we tear down the three sections of the fence (that includes the section with the hole and the two sections closer to the street). The wife goes WILD saying that if we even TOUCH the fence, she\u2019s taking us to small claims court, and the previous owner gave her a receipt from when they built the fence. Which I\u2019d LOVE to see along with proof that it\u2019s for the section in question. But I wasn\u2019t out there talking to her so I didn\u2019t get to ask. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing... the section of the fence that divides our yards has the posts on OUR side, which implies a previous owner of OUR property installed it, because posts generally go on the side of the installer; it\u2019s clearly older than the fence that goes around the other two sides of their yard; and IT IS NOT EVEN CONNECTED TO THE REST OF THEIR FENCE (which has the posts on their side by the way... because that\u2019s how fences work). \n\n[Here\u2019s a couple pics of the fence. ](https://imgur.com/a/oRU8UAj) One shows where they clearly don\u2019t connect, and the other shows that the posts are on our side, with the hole in question as a bonus. \n\nSo what all do I need to do to prove that the fence belongs to us and not them, since it\u2019s probably been up for a good 50 years and whoever installed it is long gone?",

Obviously, it was shocking to me, and I thought it was a parasite, so after some simple googling and making a Dr appointment, I'd see the Dr and tell them my symptoms... And that I thought it was trich. I saw the Dr, she was skeptical, was tested, and a week later the test came back negative. I thought wtf. I started to feel the same crawling sensations around my anus and even my bladder (why that didn't start in the first place, idk, considering what I know it is, now) and became increasingly worried. Further googling brought my attention to worms, specifically pinworms because me and my brother were eating a lot of pork like bacon at the time. I thought, OK, so I take otc meds, thinking problem solved. So I tried it, it helped mildly, I tried another bottle, didn't treat me. This is going to sound crazy, but at this point, I went to another Dr for a second opinion. I explained my symptoms were worsening because I can't get a diagnosis. The new Dr was again skeptical, after I told her that I feel a rather (now) large parasite that crawls to the tip of my penis at night and wiggles around and assumuably lays it's eggs, it's even worse when I get an erection. It got bad enough that I stopped masturbating for weeks because the sensation was so weird. That new doctor told me since I don't have bite marks ON MY SKIN, then there's no way I have parasites... Mind you guys, at this point, the eggs that this parasite was laying were hatching and I could feel hundreds if not thousands of ?baby worms? Crawling around all over my body, getting into my eyes, my nose, my ears. Taking showers only helped for day time. So, finally I went to the Er, the doctors couldn't understand why I was there, especially for a \"crawling sensation\". I went back to this ER 3 or 4 times saying it must be worms and they said there was nothing they could do, there's no test for that. Until finally, about 6 weeks ago, I started feeling the same crawling sensations on my spine and my brain, same with under my skin, I have worms that move around in my sinuses and little baby hatchlings? drop out of my nose at all times of the day, and the doctors all asked me if I have any family history of schizophrenia... I of course said no, they said well we will refer you to a therapist. I was furious. I gave them my full disclosure of my symptoms, every single thing I've mentioned in this post, they said it's simply impossible to have worms on my spine and my brain, not in America. I even went back a second time, 2 days later, literally begging for an mri or CT scan, (I have good health insurance BTW thru my job) and the Dr completely dismissed everything I said after saying things like: sometimes when I'm about to fall asleep, something in the back of my head/ neck jerks me awake, headaches, I feel movement on my spine, ive had a few mild seizures, and one bad one, they will not help me or run tests at all, no images. This is a long post I'm sorry, I have another appointment coming up with a brand new Dr, all I said was I'm having horrible headaches all the sudden and I just want images taken just so they have no bs reason to say I'm crazy. I know i don't really have a diagnosis yet, since I haven't seen my Dr yet, but I know I have a life threatening condition and the Dr's were negligent in terms of ordering a simple image of my brain/ spine.

In the six years I\u2019ve had a license, this has never happened and I\u2019m not sure what to do. I received a traffic ticket for code 21750(a)vc -unsafe driving, which is an infraction here in California. I also just received a Notice of Correction and Proof of Service in the mail, the officer wrote the wrong make of the car. Here\u2019s my take of the situation: I was driving in a one lane and it split into two lanes a few feet ahead, the car in front of me began going to the right lane, I was going to continue in the left lane. I do see how it could be considered \u201cunsafe\u201d but there was no instance where both cars were so close there could be an impact. I could physically see the lane split in front so I didn\u2019t see a problem, I was just going with the speed of traffic. Alas, I see lights and an officer pulls out behind me. I was nervous but held my composure. I tried to explain to the officer, but he didn\u2019t care to hear and I felt berated as he said \u201cDon\u2019t make me send you back to driving school, I know you saw the lines\u201d and I did see them, but don\u2019t see how it was unsafe to pass. I would like to contest this in court since I currently do not work. I\u2019m not sure if this could help within court, but a few months ago, I was a missing persons (posters and everything) I was found in a mental health facility after attempting suicide again. I\u2019ve moved back home to work on my metal health and myself. I am trying to get back to work, but depression isn\u2019t easy. Anyways, sorry to bore you but i am not in the financial situation to pay for this and can\u2019t bear asking my family. I already feel like a burden since they have been helping me out the past few months. I couldn\u2019t ask for a penny more. My clean driving record was one of the last things I really had, this is feeling like a big, crappy setback. I am asking you Reddit if you can help me. What can I do to contest this?

Without detailing all the previous issues it is important to note that the current landlord of my apartment complex is the 4th in less than 2 years. She is never in the on-site office, despite living above it. I work and commute and am gone most days but every business day I\u2019ve been home, the office has hardly been open. I\u2019ve seen her in there less than 10 times. An example of past issues: Once I locked myself out of my apartment on a Sunday; I called every number including the emergency line, emailed, and text. Luckily I was able to get in through a window because no one EVER contacted me back through any method. Not even the next day, or in the months since. \n\nOn to the issue at hand.\n\nI\u2019m a renter in San Diego, CA. My boyfriend, active duty-military, and I are both on our lease. We have lived here for 1 year and 9 months. Due to his current assignment, we are needing to break our lease 3 months early - we have military documentation with both of our names outlining the need to terminate our lease. My boyfriend is currently out of the country, so I am handling our entire move on our own. \n\nOn Jan 27, I stopped in our on-site property managers office (let\u2019s call her J) and let her know that we would be needing to move. I asked if it was just standard 30-days notice, and said it will either be March or April, but I would give notice as soon as possible.\n\nFeb 10: I dropped off a written NIV and provided our move out date, along with the military documentation. Despite the fact I dropped this during the posted business hours, J was not in the office. I provided 40 days notice, as the intended move out date is Mar 20. \n\nFeb 14: I emailed the office because no one ever made contact with me regarding my NIV. Several hours later I received an email from J stating that she \u201cwill be in contact for future documents needing signed\u201d (??)\n\nFeb 24: I again reached out through email because I still had not received any information regarding March prorate, move-out procedures, or my security deposit.\n\nFeb 26: I found and emailed the property management group that owns/oversees our property requesting follow up. I forwarded the email chain I had with J and made it clear that I received no information and no one is ever on site to discuss in person or available to answer the phone.\n\nFeb 27, 3am: I receive an email from J stating she would be calling me \u201ctomorrow\u201d to answer any remaining questions (which, was all of them). I responded with my work and cell number and noticed her that I would be at work all day over the next 3 days (sales at end of month, so 12 hour days).\n\nFeb 28, 9pm: I emailed J and the property management group again outlining what was happening and that I had never received a call from her despite her saying she would do so. The property management group has also been unresponsive. \n\nIt\u2019s now March 1st. I move out in 19 days. I haven\u2019t paid the March prorate, because no one has given me any info. At this point, I am just going to proceed with moving out, letting them take the prorate out of the security deposit, giving my forwarding address, and detailing all this in a final email.\n\nAs far as I am concerned I did everything on my part to make this a smooth and legal transaction and I\u2019m at a loss of what to do now besides just move out. My concern is obviously that they will attempt legal action of some sort or withhold the entire security deposit (which, after my estimate of the prorate, would leave ~$500 so nothing crazy).",

This car started having engine trouble. He took it to a dealer who said he needed to replace all 6 fuel injectors and was going to charge about 3k for parts and labor. I suggested he talk to my mechanic. Ne recall was mentioned or part of the quote.\n\nHe took it to my mechanic and they determined he only needed three replaced but they also found that the fuel injectors are under a BMW recall (EMISSIONS RECALL CAMPAIGN 10E-A02: REPLACE FUEL INJECTORS). The dealer who wanted to replace all 6 didn't mention this when my friend was there. My mechanic shop reached out to several BMW car centers to see about getting parts for free under the recall and they all said they had no idea what the mechanic was talking about. The mechanic replaced the injectors and my friend paid for it and some other work that needed to be done. All total the injectors cost about 1.5k in parts and labor. \n\nAfter doing some digging and double checking I am certain this car is under the recall. Now my friend would like to be reimbursed for the work that needed to be done since the dealer didn't catch it. He is not looking to make extra money, he just wants what he paid back. \n\nWe have the recall notices sent to the dealers (found it online) and we also have the recall notice sent to My Mechanic (they gave us a copy) as well as the receipts from my mechanic. My mechanic also said to let them know if we need anything else. \n\nOur next planned step is going back to the dealer and showing all the stuff we have and asking for reimbursement but before that I wanted to see if there was a better legal path to success. \n\nHow do we go about getting the work for the recall paid for?",

I'm wondering what's going to happen and if I need an attorney.\n\nAbout 6 years ago, I received a ticket for not changing lanes when an emergency vehicle was on the side of the road. I called the City of Newnan and was told the ticket was $500. I bought a money order and mailed it in.\n\nTwo years go by and I get pulled over for an expired tag. The police officer tells me that my license is suspended because I never went to court for the earlier ticket. He also said my insurance had expired. It had but I didn't know it. This was in May and my debit card had been stolen in February. I thought I had changed the information for everyone who did an automatic debit but had missed the insurance company. \n\nTo be honest, the cop did me a huge favor. It was better to find out that way then to find out after an accident. He wrote me a ticket for no insurance and one for expired tags and let me go. \n\nAt this particular time, I was having a really rough financial time. My apartment rent had gone from $800 to 1400 per month, and I was being hauled into court every other month for eviction. My parents stepped in and bought a home, about two hours from Newnan and moved me there. Needless to say, I didn't go to court for those two tickets and still had the first one outstanding.\n\nI'm almost out of my financial hole and am making plans this year to deal with these tickets. There's one for not changing lanes for an emergency vehicle, one for no insurance, and one for expired tags. What should I expect? How much should I expect to pay? Is it better to hire an attorney? \n\nI ask about the attorney because after the last set of tickets I was arrested for driving on a suspended license. When I went to court, the Athens city attorney met with me and worked out a deal so I suspect that's what will happen in Newnan too. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, I do currently have insurance and a current tag on the car.",

I don't want to take full credit for those increases, but I do mean to show I was a dedicated and productive employee with no bad marks or previous write ups, verbal or written... quite the contrary, I was lauded in my position.  (The previous manager that was doing the same job was promoted to partner allowing the gap to be filled by myself).\n\nThe problem is that the store has a cocaine problem.  I knew it, my superior knew it, he even took part in it sometimes as some of the employees were his personal friends.  I kept my nose clean.  I never thought to report it because I knew that the people above me and around me were all doing it.  Long story short, I am walking to the back lot one day and two sales people (one of them is the owners friend) ask me if I wanted a ride to the back to get my car.  Unassumingly I said yes as it is a bit of a walk.  On the way back, they offered a \"key bump\" a minor amount of cocaine.  Now, I'm not a goody goody, but I'm also not a criminal.  I relented, against my better judgement and in the parking lot we each took \"a key bump.\"  I was buzzed for 15 minutes (like chugging a coffee, the amount I took) and went back to work after my lunch break just fine.\n\nThe problem is, a friend of mine at the dealership saw the three of us driving out back and when I got back she stated, \"Oh, hey, I saw you driving back with So and So... sooooo did you do anything?\" (as if she knew the owners friend was in to that drug).  I was floored that she even brought it up and I told my friend at the dealership that they offered me a key bump, no big deal.  She openly talks about her drinking and plays it off like shes \"cool\"... whatever.  Later on that day she wrote a letter to HR.   I was interrogated by my boss (a guy who I have known for 13 years) and thought I would be best served by being honest.  \\[any lawyer right now probably says I lost the case right there and I should have kept my mouth shut and I realize that now\\] But I thought that I could be honest with my boss and be disciplined accordingly.  He fired me on the spot along with (separately) the other sales person.  The third sales person (the owners friend) escaped this firing...\n\nAfter being fired I went to a local independent clinic and performed a pee test and a hair follicle drug test that came back negative.  This is the first and only time I have done anything like that and being with the owners friend, I felt pressure to accept.  (in the back of my mind I thought I could get by with this sleight... almost like someone speeding 10 over.  Yes, cocaine is illegal, yes, any amount is punishable... yes speeding is illegal, even 10 over, but in your mind you say that its fine.  That was my train of thought anyway and obviously a wrong one.  I'm not trying to defend that here.\n\nWhat I am mad about is the peer pressure to do it (again its my fault I take full ownership but I can still be mad about it right?), but legally, my question is, do I have any recourse against my previous employer for them treating me differently that the owners friend?  How did he escape punishment when only the other salesperson was fired along with myself.  I feel like shit now too because I probably got that other guy fired by being honest with my boss and asking for a write up, never expecting to be fired.  I was more inclined to tell the truth to report it (after the fact) so that this shit wouldn't come up again.  I didn't want any part of it.  Too late...obviously.\n\nI was going to consult with local lawyer, but wanted to hear what people had to say about it here first.  I think the only outcome would be for criminal charges to be pressed against me and for the other guy to get fired as well.  I don't know what good can come from it... but I want equal and fair treatment.\n\nAs far as myself, I found another job as a general employee and will start work tomorrow.  I am inclined to just move on with my life but I couldn't sleep for the last two weeks.  I am a nervous wreck right now about the most stupid mistake I could have ever made and I am very mad about the owners friend still working there.  I went in to the owners office the day after I was fired and pleaded for a more lenient but just as serious \"write up\" and I told him exactly what happened again and who was involved and asked why the other guy didnt get fired too... he was the one that offered it!  He is bringing that shit in to this store and you're losing good people because of it and you wont act on that?  Its going to happen again to another equally unassuming employee. He said \"That's not for you to ask and I'm not responsible to tell you.\"  He felt bad, I could tell, but he ultimately sent me on my way.\n\nWhere do I go from here?  Drop it and see my doctor for some counseling?  I'm pretty broken up right now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL:DR - Did one \"key bump\" (small amount of cocaine) in a parking lot at work after being offered it unexpectedly by two salespeople as they were offering me a ride.  Another employee saw it and reported us.  One sales person and myself were fired, the third in the car (owners friend) was not fired.  Do I have any recourse here?  Not necessarily wrongful termination, I admit I should have been fired... but the owners friend was the one that offered it to me.  I would have never done it had I not thought I was going to be ostracized or not \"in the boys club.\" (even though I am a male).",

I also ordered this semen crime scene test thing which turns purple on a stain if it's semen so I will have to drip a bit on a piece of clothing then use it\n\nPeople do scummy things like that these people are traditional turks I believe, and most likely get extremely offended that I was that \"jerk\" who made them not get payed possibly because my driver decided to steal my food, or it was an restaurant issue.

The arguments that led up until that point was because I got up and yelled at my mom for continuing to allow this man who'd threatened to end my life multiple times in the past was just acting and talking like a loon!\n\nAnyways the next morning I woke up to hear him drunkenly speaking, our house's walls aren't that thick so I went out to investigate. I went outside to find beer cans laid throughout the front law. The second she saw me he fucking BOLTED past me saying \"I got something for your ass!\". He'd gone for my mom's bedroom, coming back with a gun hidden under his shorts in the front. He said \"Imma kill yo' ass today!\" \n\nI yelled saying \"There he is threatening to kill me again!\" This got the attention of my family members which my mom came out trying to argue with my sister about keeping that son of a bitch in our home. I obviously went over to my neighbors who knew his crazy ass, asking for a phone to call the police. I did however they weren't any help since it was my word vs his and they had no poof of his treat to my life. From what I heard from my sister while I was out getting the phone my mom's bf was smiling knowing he had fully gotten away with threatening my life. \n\nAnyways after they had left my sister began calling our aunt telling her of the bullshit happening and well gossip spreads. In no time my cousins came over with a gun in one of their hands 'n chased his ass to another street were they beat the ever lasting hell outta him. Unfortunately my ass followed trying to stop them and just stood there telling him he deserved to get his ass kicked for threatening my life. \n\nMy cousins drove off and I ran back to my mom whom was calling the police and giving a description of the vehicle my cousins were in. All that and she refused to call the police or kick him out after the first death threat. Mother of the year right there. \n\nAnyways when the police arrived he told the female officer me and my sister did this to him, having us arrested on the spot and taking eye witness statements. When I arrived there we were questioned, told that eye witnesses said I did put my hands on the dude (I DIDN'T BTW). I was shocked that they said I did, even mom and little sister. FUCKING crazy! \n\n\nWe got out the same day when one of our cousins came in to clear things up and we were released. Cut to the next day I'm being told my my mom and her bf that he put charges on us but didn't want us going to jail so he was gonna have 'em dropped. \n\nHe didn't.\n\nCut to this month, a week ago, he's been in jail September I believe and I was unfortunately pulled over by a cop on my way home from work due to there being an increase of stolen bikes in our area.

But this also means that employers do not need to offer severance. \n\nHowever within 2 weeks of her no longer being employed, they sent a letter stating the withdrawal of being \"job attached\", thereby revoking her furlough status, and changing her requirements for unemployment.\n\nOur primary concern is that very few people were given any severance as a result of them being furloughed. My wife and her dozens of coworkers we're actually just \"laid off\", but the company was able to avoid any severance discussion due to misdirecting everyone to a false \"furlough\" promise.\n\nA little research lead me to the \"WARN Act\", which basically says that during mass layoffs, a 100+ employee companies must give 60 days notice to those affected, and if they fail to do so must instead pay out severance. They did not give any notice, and the end result of their actions just means that they really just laid off ~30 people without severance.\n\nIs her status technically just \"laid off\"? Is there any recourse for the actions of the company? Are we entitled to severance? If any clarifications are needed I'd be happy to provide more information. Thanks!",

My friend told me about a trick that involves paying for only half an hour when you leave the car park even though u stay for over 5 hours.\nThis ended up saving me a load of money \nand I only started doing it occasionally and then made it my day to day routine.\nI recently got a letter that says I now have to pay for the full amount of time I spent in the car park over the 7 ish months I\u2019ve been doing this.\nI completely understand if I was told after a week or even a month and I had to pay it back and I\u2019m still willing to pay for that. BUT they have left it for 7 months and the total has now been accumulated to over \u00a3600. As an apprentice I cannot afford to pay for this fine and I\u2019m not sure what to do.\nIs there a law in which they have a time frame in which they have to notify me of a fine?\n\nThings to note\n - i was allowed out of the car park (the barriers lifted) and I was never told to stop until this fine\n - There are signs everywhere mentioning to pay using the \u201capp\u201d when you arrive (I paid for half an hour when I left)\n - the app has no notification other than the terms and conditions\n - the last record was a month ago, I have still been parking for over a month, I\u2019m worried I will get another fine for the months worth\n\nAny help would be appreciated, Thank You",

The account never posts anything and has been following me for months. There are actually 3 of her accounts that have been following me. \n\nI have two nieces one who is 18 going on 19 and one who is 22. \n\nThey are both not allowed at my house and are not on speaking terms with anybody in my house since 2016. I believe the 22 year old made a bunch of fake accounts on twitter about my family, stealing our pictures and I accused her of doing so. She blamed the 18 year old (the 18 year old was in surgery at the time the accounts were posting). Her mother then flew off the handle and wrote a nasty message to me. I reported all the accounts and they got taken down and I blocked my sister and my nieces on all social media. Nobody has spoke to eachother since.\n\nBefore that, the 18 year old made fake accounts about me and was taking pictures of myself behind my back and the 22 year old ratted her out. (I would say they were 13 and 15 at the time). \n\nAnyways, what\u2019s currently going on is I guess my daughters account reached out to the 18 year olds Instagram. They have been messaging and my daughters account kept bringing up about how she hates me, hates how she can\u2019t see her cousins, wants to sneak out, misses them, how she hates bullies, how she gets bullied yadda yadda. The 18 year old asked the account to send selfies but my daughters account always came up with any reason why she couldn\u2019t.\n\nI asked my daughter and she said she hasn\u2019t talked to the 18 year old or the 22 year old. She said she doesn\u2019t even know what their instagrams are.\n\nApparently the 18 year old told off the account calling out the 22 year old for hacking/impersonating it and my daughters account is now deleted. I unfollowed 3 other accounts in my daughters name.\n\nI think the 18 year old might\u2019ve made the fake account and was talking to herself and trying to start shit or the 22 year old hacked the account and was trying to talk to the 18 year old through it. Idk what\u2019s going on. Oddly enough my daughters account knew stuff that the 18 year old wouldn\u2019t know unless she was talking to the 22 year old on a different account. \n\nIt\u2019s very immature and childish. I don\u2019t know what the point is and if it\u2019s the 18 year old trying to create drama even though she told the account \u201cmy family is sick of the drama leave us alone impersonating someone is illegal you need mental help\u201d yadda yadda yadda. \n\nNone of the accounts ever post anything or have tried talking to me they all just follow me. The only person they\u2019ve reached out to was my other daughter or the 18 year old.",

I havent opened it yet. \n\nI then sent a text to her saying \"im sorry but im not doing anything with this check. here are too many red flags for me to reasonably go through with this. I will mail the check back to the address listed on it. if this is not a scam, I am sorry for the inconvenience.\" Once again, no response\n\nWhat should I do? Contact the police? Mail the check back unopened? open the check and take it to whatever bank it is listed under? Please help!!!",

I believe the 22 year old made a bunch of fake accounts on twitter about my family, stealing our pictures and I accused her of doing so. She blamed the 18 year old (the 18 year old was in surgery at the time the accounts were posting). Her mother then flew off the handle and wrote a nasty message to me. I reported all the accounts and they got taken down and I blocked my sister and my nieces on all social media. Nobody has spoke to eachother since.\n\nBefore that, the 18 year old made fake accounts about me and was taking pictures of myself behind my back and the 22 year old ratted her out. (I would say they were 13 and 15 at the time). \n\nAnyways, what\u2019s currently going on is I guess my daughters account reached out to the 18 year olds Instagram.

Our show time was for 7:20 pm, but we arrived late and didn't make our way into the auditorium until the trailers were playing. This Regal theater allowed you to purchase your seats ahead of time, so we had assigned seats.\n\nAs we made our way into the auditorium it was very dark. I remember it was during a Frozen 2 trailer and there was hardly any light in the room. My Mother-in-law was in front of us as we walked from the opening doors of the auditorium down the runway towards the seats. As you approach the screen the runway opens up to the left so that you can walk up an adjacent flight of stairs up the upper level seats or you can continue down the runway to the lower section of seats closest to the screen.\n\nA we approached the lower section of the auditorium to find our seats my Mother-in-law suddenly fell. I was shocked at the time because it wasn't just a slight trip. she fell hard enough for the entire theater to be alerted. My mother-in-law lost her footing because there was a step down to a landing that had no indication of there being a step. There was no rubber guard or reflective tape. Only a carpeted walkway that suddenly went down.\n\nMy mother-in-law at this point could not get up and was stuck in the fetal position on the landing step. My significant other ran out of the room and alerted the staff and called 911 immediately. Within minutes first responders arrived and took her to Shands hospital in Gainesville, FL.\n\nAfter the accident:\nAfter the fall my Mother-in-law had a series of x-rays done and it turns out she broke multiple ribs. She contacted a local attorney's office and inquired to see if they wanted to represent her and her case. The attorney's office agreed and said they would handle everything. All she needed to do was focus on getting better and continue to get checked up if she needed too. Shortly after the accident Regal tried to contact her, but the attorney's told her not to contact them and that they would do it for her.\n\nAfter a few months of no word from the attorney's office my mother-in-law started to get worried because the hospital was now wanting her to start paying off the fees she's started to occur. The law office kept saying over and over don't worry about it, we'll handle it.\n\nNow:\nMy Mother-in-law was contacted by her attorney's office saying they no longer want to represent her and her case. Now they are saying after all this time the theater was in compliance with regulations because of small lights running along the bottom of the wall on the walkway in the auditorium.\n\nNow she's feels like she's up shit creek without a paddle. She is in no way able to off these medical expenses by herself as a single mother. What do you think our next best option should be?",

Apparently the law says that based on my salary, I'm to give the ex approximately 14.6% of what I gross.  Childcare expenses are low because it's subsidized.  Overall, not terrible, but still hurts.\n\nThe ex disclosed they are using the child support payments to pay their mortgage and living expenses.  They waived spousal support in the agreement.  Child wears almost exclusively hand-me-downs.\n\nIs this normal?  Is there any obligation of the parent with physical custody to spend the money from that payor on the child?  And if not, can the person receiving the money justify demanding more money for childcare if the child support money isn't being spent on the child in the first place?",

When I returned home one day I saw my things. I messaged her on twitter and thanked her for returning my things. A few days later I was out and got really drunk and messaged her on insta saying I missed her and sent a video of us when we were together. I woke up the next morning and there was a text from a number I didn\u2019t know, it was her mom and it was saying \u201cshe blocked my number for a reason, and by messaging her on Instagram it was harassment\u201d I texted back and said \u201cit isn\u2019t like that but won\u2019t contact her again\u201d.

I\u2019ve been making really good money at it and it and I pick my hours so working other businesses isn\u2019t a problem. It has the potential to become a house flipping venture backed by some people with more money than me but it\u2019ll be a ways down the road.\n\nI also recently graduated college which led to me landing a contract with a very small (but rapidly growing) music photographer/media co. as a subcontractor.

Could this be some fraud thing and I get held liable for it? From looking at his instagram he just looks like a real, rich man, but you never know. Or could the money somehow become my responsibility to pay? I don't know, I'm a little freaked out. I didn't expect it to work.

The jist of the story is I bought what I thought was real AirPods at a wholesale price but turned out to be fake. I ordered 14 the first time (kept one for myself) and sold the others as real AirPods. Once I reordered the shipments (2 shipments for a total of roughly 45) got seized by customs and I was told they were counterfeit. As soon as I heard this I canceled another order I was about to place, demanded a refund on the seized orders, reported the seller on Alibaba, and gave refunds with no questions asked to any buyers of the product (which over half of them ended up taking). I ended up getting a letter about a month later from customs confirming the product had been seized (there was no reason for me to try and get them back), by which time I had refunded most customers, made a net loss of over $500 and tried to move on. Obviously I felt terrible and have learned to always do more research but I thought the situation was over after not receiving any letters, refund requests, etc. for months.\n\nNow fast forward back to today. I have no problem telling this law firm my source, how many and where I bought the earbuds from and confirming that I have ceased this activity. However, I don't have a copy of the sales records. I also would rather not have to hire a lawyer to write back to them because that could cost hundreds or several thousand dollars, depending on the firm. Would I be okay just not responding to the letter as this is such a low-profile case and I haven't tried to import anything in months, or do I need to respond? If so, could I just respond myself or do I need a lawyer? And if I responded myself could I just do it over the phone or by email instead of via snail mail? \n\nhttps://m.imgur.com/a/a6okiTS\n\nSorry for so many questions but any response would be appreciated. I am not worried about being sued or in any legal trouble, especially because this was such a small amount of product, I lost money, and I tried to amend buyers after I realized what happened, I just want to respond accordingly so I can finally put this whole thing to rest.",

The other day, her boyfriend came to visit her at work, and found a misplaced wallet  on one of the benches in the store. For reasons I cannot comprehend, instead of giving it to the staff to keep behind the counter, he left and put it in a nearby mailbox, going off that rumor(?) that if you put a lost wallet into a USPS mailbox, the post office will make some sort of effort to mail it to the supposed owner. I guess the owner of the wallet came back to the store and had them check the cameras, because after they reviewed the tape they confronted my friend about what happened (she had not known at this point) and said they saw him put the wallet into his pocket. They subsequently suspended her while they compile a report, and she is concerned they are going to fire her. They do not have a proper HR department, it is a small local company.\n\nSo, I know NY is at at-will employment state, but i was wondering what the legality behind firing her over her boyfriend's actions is? There is no evidence that my friend knew about the wallet before he took it, nor does she have any involvement on camera.

They seemed great and seemingly provided a level of service beyond any the agencies in our state (OR). They supposedly have a great screening process with birth moms. They are supposed to provide counseling for a chunk of time to help her confirm this is the right path for her before they even introduce her to the adoptive parents she chose. The payment is made in 2 phases. Phase 1: $13k at sign on. This covers the cost of marketing you to potential birth moms. Once selected by a birth mom, you meet and decide if it\u2019s a good fit and whether you\u2019d like to move forward. We were chosen in Aug 2019 and paid phase 2 payment after deciding to move forward with the opportunity (another 13k to the agency plus 10k for attorney fees for both our attorney and our birth moms attorney). They pressured us to pay the phase 2 payment within hours of meeting her. Three weeks later our birth mom decided to parent. This is totally within her right and we wish her the best! I mention the short period of time due to our agency stating what a great screening and counseling program they have. It seems like if she would have had another conversation or two, we could have been saved time, money, and heartbreak. Luckily, our agency is supposed to continue to market us until we finalize an adoption through them. Ever since we made the phase 2 payment, our agency has provided less than optimal service to us. We didn\u2019t hear from them with an update for 6 months after the opportunity dissolved. We were told our profile would be marketed through social media and it never was. We are hoping to cut our loses and get SOME of our money back so we can look into another path to grow our family. We\u2019ve completely lost hope in this agency. Our profile is on their website but we rarely hear from them and when we do, it\u2019s an apology regarding their poor service. On their website they state they provide refunds for adoptive parents in the case of a disruption of an opportunity. However, they will not refund any fees and instead recommend us to file for the adoption tax credit. Do I have a case to recover some fees and go separate ways? I\u2019m concerned because I don\u2019t think the contract goes into social media marketing or customer contact requirements- that being said they might not be breaking the contract..

Well my dad had to deal with a different doctor (doctor #2) due to something unrelated and he mentioned the swollen lymphnodes and stomach issues to doctor #2. This doctor ordered a few tests to get to the bottom of it and it turns out my dad has mantle cell lymphoma, a rare and agressive form of cancer that will most likely end up killing him down the road unless a cure is found. This type of cancer is also related to the roundup class action suit. My dad used round up all his adult life on our lawn however this was just general lawn keeping, he wasn't using it as much as a farmer would but just a thought. He's wondering if he should/could pursue legal action against his doctor that essentially did nothing or if he should see if he qualifies to take legal action in the roundup case. I know the general advice would be consult with a lawyer who does medical malpractice and see what they think but with chemo treatments he is busy and doesn't feel well so I don't want him taking a ton of time to meet with lawyers for something that would be frivolous.

Now worried if she's angry it could get physical but I also wonder what it might look like if I took legal action.\n\n1) I am afraid to open this can of worms but also am afraid to let this person keep going in the world. Are there legal mechanisms to keep me safe ? \n\n2) what are possible outcomes ? Mandatory therapy? Jail ? Idk? I'd prefer mandatory therapy but I have no idea how it works. I think the crime is \"criminal harassment\"\n\n3) are restraining orders useful or useless ? \n\nI am in Canada.",

Throughout the process, we kept asking him about an inspection but he told us it wasn't necessary for a mobile home and then that we had to find an inspector on our own if we wanted one. Didn't know any better. After living here a few weeks, we started to find lots of problems with the home and after getting it checked, we learned that the electricity might not be grounded (when a family member got an electric shock from the sink)and it needs a lot of upgrades (which we completely understand and are working on it). Reached out to the realtor and he became very defensive and rude, telling us to sue him if we want to. Unfortunately, we don't know much about the law and if this is possible. Reached out to his manager and have been ignored since. At a lost of what to do. This has been very stressful dealing with and I appreciate any help. We live in California.",

A friend told me that he was wanting to buy some land by his house but the guy who owns it has a weird contract you have to sign. It says that If you buy the land you can\u2019t put a trailer on it, you can\u2019t raise livestock on it, and you have to have a paved driveway. I live in Alabama and everyone and their mother has cows, my friend wants to buy a land and raise livestock and put a trailer on it until they can build a house. I was just wondering how that would work if he was to buy the land and 100% own it but violate the contract they signed. Would the man be able to take back the land from them or take them to civil court? Is that even allowed since the man no longer owns the land if he were to sell it?",

I\u2019m going to try to make this short and sweet and not get too much into the science of this stuff. So she is a kind of newer hairstylist and she had a truly freak accident happen to her while working on someone. She was doing a highlight on a girl and she got about halfway up the girls head with the foils and the girl complained that the foils were hot. My coworker touched them and immediately realized something was wrong because they were super hot. So she yelled for me and we immediately started pulling the foils out and rinsing the girls hair. It was clear that even though it hadn\u2019t been on long at all(maybe 10-15 minutes) it had severely damaged her hair. Obviously we were both distraught and couldn\u2019t believe this happened. I have seen something similar once or twice in my near 10 year career and this typically results from either the client using cheap box color or sometimes from things like mineral build up on the hair from hard water/well water.  So both of these things are completely out of the stylists control. The girl refused any further treatments to help her hair and wouldn\u2019t let us dry it or cut it to see if we could make adjustments. About a month later, the girl sued my coworker and the salon owner(who is no longer the owner, and no longer working in this salon). The salon owner called her insurance who assured her it was no big deal and these kinds of lawsuits come up all the time. Since then, the salon owner left and doesn\u2019t really speak to us anymore and hasn\u2019t said anything else about the lawsuit so we just assumed it had been taken care of by insurance. Now this girl is suing them civilly. I plan on reaching out to the ex-salon owner to see if the insurance paid this girl anything or if it got dismissed. I guess I\u2019m just looking for advice to give to my coworker because I know she is freaking out all over again about this and it is causing her severe stress. I feel so bad and want to help her because it was literally just a freak accident completely out of her control.",

It is a part of my situation and te accused does know this.\n\nMy former employer from about a year ago has been harassing me via text for about a year, and then on Wednesday, 2/26/2020, he escalated to stalking. That morning I received a vaguely threatening text message of \u201cSee You Soon.\u201d Then he showed up to my place of work. Which was on a day I was normally off but got called in to work at a location I don\u2019t usually work at. After he showed up to work I called the police cause it was a scary situation and the guy has a drinking problem. The responding police officer called him and issued a no-contact order,  and was told if he showed up to any of the locations we have he would be trespassed.  Have photo and video evidence of him in the store. \n\nNot long after that, he posted a death threat publicly on Facebook video, where he directly named me and said we was gonna put a .45 to my head and pull the trigger because I didn\u2019t know what a real threat was. My current employer actually called me about that one to warn me as soon as he saw it. He can also be watched saying, oh look, the cops aren\u2019t near you now. He has since deleted it, but I was able to record the death threat. I have him on camera coming into the store that day wearing the same clothes in death threat video. I called the police back after that and they added to the report. This wasn\u2019t the first time he has shown up to my work at a different location, either. At that time, I remarked to my coworker how I hated it and have asked him to leave me alone multiple times. The next day I filed for an order of protection \n\nThe day after I filed the police report, his business associate/partner reached out to my current employers\u2019 girlfriend with lies and slander. Which prompted my boss to question me about these lies?  And that did for a day or two cause a strain with my current employer. I have proof this was done and evidence it was a lie and thus slander. Being the day after the police report seems like retaliation and witness tampering/harassment. I called the police again just to add it to the report. \n\nThis wasn\u2019t the first time my former employer said something to my current employer either. Former employer has gone to my boss prior, the reason I know this is my boss came to me afterward and said he had it out for me. \n\nI have had to ask off tomorrow from work for mental health Dr. appointments because this is causing me such tremendous emotional distress. Also have had to miss work for legal matters like getting the order of protection filed. I also believe he has caused my side website business harm and the same with my festival because of his mouth.\n\nI have collected and documented several forms of harassment, and I have video of the stalking and death threat. \n\nI am told he is jealous because I also put on a large annual event, and it is getting to be that time of year again, but this evidence is exceptionally damning and seems open and shut somewhat. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIs there any civil action here other than the order of protection?",

(Also, I don't know if this matters, but for context- she is trans, I am not.)  \n\n\nI (20F) dated a girl (20F) from my freshman year to junior year of high school, but continued to be friends (sometimes having brief flings) up to my senior year. Over the course of our three year relationship she sexually assaulted me and raped me multiple times. Unfortunately, I cannot recall every specific time, and I can't put dates to any of the occasions. However, I can make a rough timeline, and call recall the particularly traumatic events in detail.  \n\n\nWhen we were dating, she acknowledged that she raped me, but begged me not to go to the police. I was overly sympathetic and believed it to be my fault, so I never did and she kept getting away with it. I have since broken off my friendship with her during my Freshman year of college, and we have not spoken since then (save for the couple of times she tried to contact me.)  \n\n\nI am now finally considering pressing charges. However, there are some things I'm concerned about. There is no physical evidence, and I only told two person that it happened when I was actually in a relationship with her (one is a close friend, the other also turned out to be a rapist, unfortunately.) We would mostly talk about it face to face, and while I have a couple of very brief discord/skype chatlogs about the events, they're INCREDIBLY vague. Ie. \"are you okay after what happened tonight?\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince the event, I have only told one other person from back home, who is still friends with her. When I told him, he said that he fully believed me, and that while she had told him some of the story, he was unaware of how extensive the damage was. He also mentioned to me that she is, quote, 'morally fucked.' It makes me concerned for other people's safety, INCLUDING her boyfriend.  \n\n\nFor me to consider doing this, I need to know the likelyhood that I will be taken seriously. All I have to testify with would be word of my own personal experience, evidence of my trauma, the few people I told, those tiny bits of chat logs. Even though I know I'm not lying, I'm terrified of being harassed and shamed. Her family hates me very personally. I think that she's fully moved on from the situation, but I haven't. I don't want her to get away with it, but I also don't want to be accused of false accusations because my case isn't strong enough.  \n\n\nAny advice?",

These metal slabs are sticking out probably 4-5 inches from the poles. The parking spots are tight so the 4-5 inches of metal slab intruding into the spot makes a difference. In the fall, when the Toyota I park next too was a little too far over, I hit the slabs and it ripped a hole in my car. Luckily, I was already going to get a new car.

The email was asking if I would be interested in modeling tomorrow at 2PM, but didn't address me by name, so it felt pretty generic. Of course, the first thing I did was google the name in the email address, and all I could really find was a missing persons report from 2017 in Grand Rapids, Michigan. The email address was @ [grcc.edu](https://grcc.edu), which stands for Grand Rapids Community College, which leads me to believe this email address is actually likely associated with this missing person-- especially granted it does not seem like a terribly common name, and I imagine it's not easy to make a fake school email.\n\nWhat should I do? I feel like I'm being slightly alarmist, but I also feel like, if even not for my own safety, if this actually has anything to do with a person who is currently missing, I should definitely report this to someone.\n\nFor context, I'm a 23 year old male and I don't live anywhere near Grand Rapids, although I did relocate from the midwest about 7 months ago.\n\nAlso- if this is the wrong subreddit to post in, please let me know I'd be more than happy to take this elsewhere.\n\nThank you in advance for your advice!",

There are two issues I am bring forth that I am concerned about.  (There is a third as well but I think I am okay there. He was supposed to provide me with a document within 90 days after the order and he still hasn't. He claims I did not provide him with it either. I have a paper trail for all of it on my end. Including where I update and notify him of the final report)\n\nWe have in the order that:\n\n1. Both parties will respond to communication regarding the minor child in 12 hours. (He does not. I have multiple examples)\n2. Parents  agree to share cost of mutually agreed upon extracurricular activities.  (How can it be mutually agreed on when he does not abide by issue 1)\n\nI filed on the ground that he repeatedly violates the 12 hour rule (and I am not being a stickler - I'm waiting days for responses and sometimes never getting any even if he messages about a different matter in the meanwhile)\n\nI also claim he does not split the cost of extracurricular activities. I understand he didn't specifically agree to them but as I mentioned before - he just completely disregards the request entirely.\n\nAn example:\n\nMy son's dad does not respond to probably about 75% of communication regarding our child. One specific issue I am addressing is that I  messaged and emailed him regarding an activity our child wanted to do.  There was an early bird discount if you signed up by a specific date.\n\nI spoke with him in person twice before the sign up deadline. He never responded yes or no.\n\nThere were at two texts asking him to let me know about the activity as well.\n\nHe  had about 6 days before the early bird deadline. The cost for the  program without the discount was about $900. With the discount it was  $750.\n\nSo my question is - which trumps which?\n\nYes he never agreed but he also never responded. He had way more than 12 hours to consider it.\n\nAny thoughts? I am really nervous. Thanks so much.\n\nOH  btw he also did this same thing regarding another activity. No  response. He did not share the cost of a single extracurricular activity  in all of 2019. He makes plenty of money so it's not that.",

The seller's realtor shot us a counter offer saying that the seller owed more than that on the house and $207,000 was as low as he could go. We still found that price acceptable and we signed a contract to buy.\n\nI endes up googking the seller when his name showed up in the paperwork... and well, he is in prison and his father is handling the sale of his estate. He raped and molested a family friend's daughter repeatedly over the course of 2 years (from the ages of 5 to 7) and when the girl came forward and the police seized his phone, they also found THOUSANDS of photos of child pornography and several videos as well. \n\nCommence the heebie jeebies! I wanted to back out of the deal immediately, because ewww but my husband and I decided we would make the best of it.\n\nBUT THEN when our realtor did the title search, we found out that the house has a $174,000 lien on it and it is for restitution owed to the victim. We want to be done with this house, there is no possible way they will be able to get that lien removed in the next 2 weeks (they have until the closing date which is March 6th and then 5 business days after to get it off the title or the deal falls through). But we don't want to wait for all that, our lease is up on March 15th and our rental company doesn't do month to month, we need to find a new house and fast but we can't put an offer in until we are released from this current contract.\n\nDespite MULTIPLE attempts to send a release of contract form (even one offering for them to keep our $1000 earnest money) the seller, his realtor and his lawyer REFUSE to release us. They claim they were unaware there was a lien on the house (which is untrue), they claim the lien isn't supposed to be on the house at all and they claim they can and will have the lien removed within their alloted time frame. We are being held hostage.\n\nFrom everything I have read, there are multiple channels that have to be gone through to have a lien like this removed and they include but are not limited to negotiating with the victim's family to take a lesser amount than what they are owed in restitution (The seller owes $160,000 on the mortgage, we are purchasing the home for $207,000 and so they are hoping to get the victim's family to take the almost $50,000 the seller would be making in profit as restitution rather than the $174,000 they are owed) and if the family were to agree to that, it would also have to go before a judge. I just don't see that happening within the next 2 weeks. But here we are... \n\n\nOur time line is completely messed up, we have no idea where we are going to live after our lease is up on the 15th and we are basically being held hostage in a contract for a house we no longer want.\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions for what we can do to terminate this contract (other than waiting out the time)? \n\nThe seller, realtor and lawyer are lying that they didn't know about the lien, otherwise they wouldn't have denied our initial offer of $185,000 saying that the seller owed more than that on the house... cause he only owes $160,000 on the house. They purposely lied to get more money out of us to try and have enough to give the victim's family a small payoff of the restitution owed. But how can we prove that? They are ibviously trying to sell this house under false pretenses and didn't disclose the lien... \n\nWe are afraid what will happen is that we will have to wait out the time period they have to remove the lien and then find ourselves on the 13th of March with no house bc they can't remove it and then our lease ends on the 15th and we have nowhere to go...",

The woman they hired  gave her two weeks notice so her last day was that Friday, on the Thursday me and my coworker hired after me were laid off even though she got to stay for another day. What I think isn\u2019t right is they let someone after me stay an extra day but to only find out I was on my last day of probation for my job otherwise I would of made it. I feel used they used me unless the last day they could then laid me off. Now moving further I went to apply for EI while I look for a job, so I have to go get my ROE and to my surprise it said dismissed in probation term or whatever. I called I was mad they told me I was laid off but now it says I was fired? So I called and the girl couldn\u2019t help me at all say gave every excuse in the book and that she wasn\u2019t the one to deal with that, I have called many times to talk with that woman I should be talking to and she  ignores my calls and won\u2019t call me back. Anyways I applied for EI and a guy called me and was like you said you were laid off but your ROE says you were dismissed. I explained I was told I was laid off and even tried calling and they couldn\u2019t get there shit together to figure it out, so he calls them and they confirmed I was laid off so long story short I got my EI, but in that time my ROE said I was fired they hired back the guy behind me and from what I\u2019m aware that\u2019s illegal. I\u2019m a very shy and quite guy but very hard working and never missed a day and no one who has worked with me can understand what has happened, I heard and they were told at least five different reasons why they won\u2019t hire me back and none of them make sense.

A little community started on Twitter.\n\nThere's this \"online couple\" that have been dating for two years now, and broke up less than a week ago. They both live in the same state, and have met up on many occasions, and even started having sex. I guess the guy was hurt or whatever, but a couple days ago he went on a rant and posted on Twitter she lied to him about her age, and was actually *14* (and told everyone she was 18). She then posted that she told him months ago her real age, and they were still dating as if he didn't care.\n\nI also knew this girl, and had her personal number (I myself did *not* know she 14 either or I would've have never even started talking to her). I asked her if she was really 14 and she said yes and also told me that the guy knew her real age months ago. When they had sex, she was 13. The guy is 20, so he was possibly 19 and having sex with a 13 year old that he met in a video game. He tried to embarrass and turn people against her with his post, but in reality just exposed himself for being a pedophile. This is the statutory rape incident.\n\nThe child predator incident is happening at the same time. This guy who is one of her online friends, has publicly been declaring \"his love\" for her on many occasions. I don't know much about him, but even *today* aka after she admitted to being 14, he's still doing things like leaving a bunch of heart eyes under her pictures and telling her he loves her on Twitter.\n\n\nI have the predators twitter, Instagram, and what state he lives in. As for her \"ex boyfriend\", I have his Instagram, Twitter, and state. As for the girl, I have her socials and her phone number. This entire situation is insane and I feel wrong for not doing anything about it. But do I even have enough information for a report?",

But, my brothers wouldn't let her get close to me. But.. My brothers don't know that this is happening to me which is why she still has custody over me.\n\nAnd my last option would be to stay with my mom and live out the rest of my years until I graduate high school.

After carefully examining all of her paperwork, and asking her about it, here's what I know.\n\n1. She was accused of smuggling illegal aliens in September of 2018 through a Mexico-USA land border crossing\n2. She was in a public taxi at the time of the detainment as a passenger (I would consider that important). A public taxi in Mexico is a taxi where multiple people enter the taxi and split the taxi cost to go across US-Mexican border to the USA.\n3. She at the time of detainment had a United States B1/B2  Valid non expired visa and she was a visa holder for the past 20 years without any incidents/infractions.\n4. She was not the driver and she a passenger of the vehicle, at the time of the incident, both her and the driver had valid visas. The other passengers didn't have USA visas. \n5. What she told immigration officials was that she was taking a taxi to the USA because she wanting to go clothes shopping in the USA and didn't want to walk across the border because it was raining that day. She told immigration officials that she does not know the other people in the taxi and that they are strangers who are just using the public taxi as a cheaper option to cross the border.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow my central question regarding this is after a US immigration official rejects a visa application, what are legal grounds that can be used to dispute the accusation for inadmissibility? Is there any legal avenues my girlfriend can do to dispute these accusations?

The other day I had a group phone call and spoke with M as well as another psychologist whom I had never met. It was not long into the phone call before the psychologist brought up very sensative information about myself of which she could only have known if M had told her. Keep in mind I have never expressed to M or anyone that I am serious about suicide or that I have deliberate intent to harm anyone let alone myself (the only two exceptions to confidentiality I can find. I have expressed that I do occasionally experience suicidal thoughts but I have been very clear that I'm not serious about it. \n\nIt didnt alarm me at first but the more I think about it, the more it does.

Once the weather cooled, the ants pretty much disappeared until recently. By early February, they were back as if they never left so I contacted property management again about the ants.

I went to my class about 30-1hr late got into the building sat down and basically decided I was too late to get anything meaningful from class that day. I bolted off my chair or got up quickly (about 2-3 steps then went at a normal pace) made a sharp turn and went down the hallway to my to the door leading to my car. There was a girl walking infront of me but I gave her tons of space and didn't walk quickly behind her or anything. She leaves through the exit infront of me but I looked for a water fountain and checked my phone for about a min before I leave. Now I left and looked for my car which isn't a common car so easy to spot, find the same car try to open the door , it didn't automatically unlock like it should so I pulled out keys. I hit the lock button and the car didn't respond so I figured it was the wrong car. At this point I start looking for my car and hear groans but I didn't think anything of it, I found my car and left right away.  \n\n I don't know if it was the girl in front of me or someone else seeing me try to open their car door, but later when I walked down the hallway a few people passed me and said something about me being a stalker and i'm 100% sure they were talking about me. I'm literally praying that there are cameras in the building because i'm 100% sure in no way someone could come to that conclusion with the footage. I didn't follow the person for more then a hallway and to the people talking should've seen me walk to my car. I could be getting Me2'd but I don't know anyone that goes to the school and don't have social media. I want to know how I can get the footage from the school and if I can post it online when I get it to clear my name. Honestly if there are only mild repercussions  I will post it because fuck it. I don't know what's going to happen to me and I don't want to be known as that guy where I live. I've never been in any other situation that's as skechy as this, this has to be what they're talking about.  I think me 2 is a really good thing for society.

My uncle decided that this was a good time to start taking her car and literally just grabbed the keys and took off with it. I get home from work yesterday to find that he\u2019s parked her car in the driveway entrance and blocked it so I would have to park on the street. Normally this wouldn\u2019t have made me so incredibly angry, but I think it was a build up of having to listen to him treat both my grandma and my mom like s*** for however many years. I lost it a little bit and went into the house screaming, and he continued sitting there on the couch. Admittedly that made me even more angry and I threw my coat at his face, to which he then stood up and hit me twice in the head. I\u2019ll be the first to admit that I\u2019m not the strongest woman out there and he\u2019s a lot taller than me as well, so I did not retaliate. He didn\u2019t do anything beyond that, but cue more yelling from both me, my mom, and him. My cousin eventually helped move the cars and he finally drove off, and I haven\u2019t seen him since. \n\nI know I shouldn\u2019t have been so aggressive to throw the coat at him and will reign that in the next time.

            "selftext": "So about 6 months ago my girlfriend started looking into the possibility of going back to school to get a second degree/masters degree. While perusing through options she a found a program through a legitimate University with a brick and motor campus that is in a near by state. This university required her to \u201capply\u201d before she could get a price on what courses would cost. This application was simply just making an account and giving her name and address. All she did after the application was click on courses to see the cost.  After realizing it was not financially possible at the time she decided to not go any further and had not logged onto the account since. Fast forward to last week and she gets a bill in the mail from this University for $2000. So apparently her giving them her name and address and her clicking on the course to see what it would cost was enough to enroll her? We went back and looked through her email and found an email from 5 months ago stating she was enrolled and would be billed. Obviously she should have caught the email but as soon as you give any of these schools any interest they spam the crap out of you. So she simply just ignored anymore correspondence from them. This just seems extremely predatory. She never took any classes or anything and only logged onto the account she made once. Is there anything we can do or is she actually obligated to pay that back now? We certainly don\u2019t need it going to collections... Any help would be great, thanks. \n\n(Not including the name of the school as I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s against the rules or not)",

This interstate then turns into a more town like area where the supposed speed was 30, it then turns back into an interstate where the speed is back at 55 . I admit that my initial speed was around 60 because I was on an interstate, but once I realized I was longer on the Interstate and  I also noticed other cars slowing down,  I slowed down to 40 to match their speed. I was at 38-40 MPH when the officer pulled me over. He showed me a radar showing the number 60, and told me that's what he clocked me at back in the more city like area (where there was a gas station). I didn't admit to knowingly speeding. I told him I was going 60 because the road i was on had a limit of 60 MPH. He claimed the town-like area, with the gas station where he clocked me at had a limit of 30MPH. He wrote me a citation (with an automatic court sentence).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't believe I didn't anything wrong. It is possible i missed the sign shifting from 60 to 30, seeing as this was at night and I was in the left lane, but i definitely slowed down to match the speed of the cars in this area before i got pulled over. \n\nThis is my first time being given a speeding ticket with court summons, i have no idea what to expect...

            "selftext": "I'm pretty sure I have three cases buried in here. I'll do my best to tell them chronologically, but I can't promise to separate them.  \n\n\nAlright, so here's the full story.  \n\n\nBack in July of 2018 I was discharged from a bankruptcy and walked away from everything. At some point after that. I changed my legal name and gender/sex in the February prior on my birth certificate and driver's license. and updated the rest of my things, including my social security identification stuff  to reflect my new name and legal gender/sex shortly after my bankruptcy was discharged.  \n\n\nI ended up being forced to get another vehicle. My uncle had an 08 civic ex with super low miles. I agreed to pay him $4800 at 0% interest in payments which were originally $100 every two weeks. Those payments became $50 every two weeks, and then became \"Pay what you can when you can.\" Within the first month of agreeing to the terms, My uncle decided to transfer the title to my mom. He didn't ask me about it, He just signed the title to her. She was not included in the standing contract at the time this was done. I was never put on the title, but I was told that It would be put in my name when I finished paying it off. I figured that I was going to get screwed on this, but I needed the car and I couldn't get to work without it. I kept paying. Eventually it needed a lot of repairs I couldn't afford. about $700 worth, an oil change, front brakes, two tires and an alignment. My uncle covered those and told me he was proud that I was making strides to do better in my life.  \n\n\nI fell on hard times some time between the finalization of the name and gender change. The job I was working at started discriminating against me because of my gender identity and sexual orientation (I'm poly-amorous and pan-sexual). They outed me within the first week of updating my info as requested for tax reasons to the entire company (its a big dealership group with over 20 dealerships in at least 4 states) and told me I could *not* come to the meeting they outed me at in my own workplace,  restricted me from using the men's bathroom (I was okay with this, I don't see myself as a man in any way shape or form) and then told me I couldn't use the locker room, despite it being the *only* locker room at the car dealership. I was a porter there and It wasn't that uncommon for me to be dirtied by the job. I worked with fluids, oils, lubricants, coolants, and other liquids. I was upset by this and got myself a lawyer.  \n\n\nThings got a bit better. they re-did the single stall unisex bathroom in the shop area. (It was the only bathroom I was told I could use). They repainted the disgustingly filthy walls. I got a mirror and a wall mounted fold out chair. They installed some hooks for me to hang things on. But they refused to put in a shower or let me use the one in the other locker room. I should have pressed for more, but they made an attempt and things were okay for a while. By this point I was starting to feel anxious about going to work and on some level I was feeling the effects of depression rearing its ugly head again.  \n\n\nIn early December of 2018 I was admitted to a hospital on two separate occasions within a week of each other after contemplating suicide (I actually tried the second time). Both times I was discharged because they didn't think I was a danger to myself and I hadn't actually done anything or \"didn't overdose bad enough to need medical assistance.\"  \n\n\nI had called in a lot at this point. Things got worse and worse from here after I had a disagreement with one of my co-workers. I found some sexually harassing messages on my locker, which was easily visible in the common area of the building. I took a picture of this and told my direct manager, who basically scoffed at me and said that \"there are no security cameras and we can't prove who did it, and we aren't gonna try either.\" I was visibly angry and trembling at this and stormed out of his office and left for the day.  \n\n\nApril of 2019 rolls around and I'm starting to get to the point where the anxiety is so debilitating that I frequently (twice a week, minimum, not counting sundays) cannot get out of bed for 2 to 6 hours after waking up. I made it a point to call in and tell my boss about this every time it happened and was severe enough that I was going to be at least 20 minutes late. I got written up for it twice between the end of april and late may. It progressively got worse and I eventually got fired on 6/4/19. I have direct deposit set up and so I keep watching for that last paycheck to appear. I go on a vacation I had paid for on my 31st birthday, which was june 6th. The company then says I owe them $18 for a pair of pants and refuses to give me my paycheck. I realize, I have to get on this plane and I don't have time to sit around and argue about the legality of them not paying my paycheck. I told them that it was illegal for them to withhold my paycheck over a \"lost\" pair of pants (I maintain that I did not ever receive this pair, because I got 11 pairs of pants and they said I had gotten 12.) and they basically laughed at me and told me to get a lawyer. I got back from my trip about 6 days later. I barged into the dealership a few days after and demanded my paycheck. I showed them the relevant law and they *finally* give me my last paycheck. I ended up being kicked from two of my vehicle related social groups because I got fired from this job. I end up taking my part time job to texas in mid july. I move to iowa on Halloween of the same year, and now i'm back in chicago since new years day after a ton of bullshit. I've been without a permanent address or job since 1/1/20.  \n\n\nAround 1/18/20, my mom agrees to help me get a temporary hold while I continue looking for a job. I'm not on great terms with her (more or less exiled from family events and I really don't talk to anyone else in my family, my dad abused my mom, brother, and I for 23 years until she FINALLY divorced him.) since I started transition and came out, despite my brother being gay and in the process of marrying his boyfriend/fiance. So she tells me I can store my car at her place and I should give her the keys so she can move it around if it needs to be. She takes me to the alleged location in the city and drops me off. I get my stuff from the car, close the trunk, and attempt to go say good bye. As soon as the trunk closes (its automatic) I hear her shift into drive and see her take off. I don't even get to say goodbye. I realize that she has basically dumped me off in a random place. I have the name of the place I'm going, so I walk almost an hour to get there. Turns out its an international hostel and they won't let me stay because my address on my license has a zip code starting in 60xxx.  \n\n\nI call my mom and she says she's not coming back, fuck me, I'm a terrible person and I can rot. I tell her I'm coming to get my car and she says I can't have it back and that she is selling it. She's on the title, I'm not. I haven't been able to pay on the car except for a few sporadic payments since October 1st after I lost my part time job and I ended up in a psych ward in texas for 12 days because i attempted to shoot myself in the head twice with my roommate's unloaded handgun, right as my roommate was walking in the door. All of this because I got investigated for sexual harassment after I was asked by a co-worker if my breasts were implants (They are not)  and then to see a topless picture of myself, which I was stupid enough to show her, and then I got fired after the investigator refused to listen to anything I said and basically told me I was full of shit, despite him only being on the west coast of the country almost a 6 hour flight away.  \n\n\nSo i'm not sure if i have a case at this point (statute of limitations) on the job I got fired from in June, but I'm almost positive I should be able to sue my uncle for something, (not sure what it would be aside from breach of contract) and my mother for stealing my car. I paid $1825 in payments, Insurance costs totalled around $4000 (full coverage, recent tickets and an accident). and the car was worth about $4000 in its condition at the time it was stolen. I couldn't tell my insurance that the owner of the vehicle had stolen it from me, and they were also on the policy with me.  \n\n\nAny advice would be great.",

He remembers vaguely signing something but not what it was for specifically, just that he now owned the house and she was $50,000 richer. Come to find out later, she gambled away all of the money. In the will it stated that my husband would get the money when he was 18 for college, but if by the time he was 20 he didn't go to college, he could use the money for whatever he wanted. \n\nHere's where I'm confused. Is there a way to find out if what she did was legal? We have not talked to her in 3 years as she is incredibly abusive and just downright a horrible person. We have been 0 contact since we saw her 3 years ago, so I do not want to talk to her about any of this. Is there like a public record in Oklahoma for us to check to at least make sure she is paying the property taxes? We know through relatives that she is driving for uber/lift but that's all she does for money. My husband and I are trying to buy a house and I don't want to get screwed over. Any information about this would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.",

            "selftext": "Tl;dr: I\u2019m not on the lease anymore at my apartment. Roommate won\u2019t give me access to remove bank account on rent payment site because \u201che can\u2019t afford rent for March\u201d \n\nBack in May, I (F23) moved in with a friend (M25) after finishing grad school. He had signed the lease in February and added me on to the lease as an additional person. I signed my lease, which, the same as his, ended January 29,2020. \n\nUpon moving in, I found out quickly after a couple months he was super neglectful of his dog. He didn\u2019t always feed him every day and he was super skinny. He left him with me for days on end without asking if it was okay and basically dumped this poor animal on me, leaving me to feed him and take him out frequently. He left the country once for 10 days without even asking me if I was ok with watching the dog and didn\u2019t even give me a thanks when I came back. Oh, and he didn\u2019t tell me till afterwards that he hadn\u2019t payed any pet deposit or anything for him even though he was supposed to. \n\nSo by December, I was pretty ready to move out. It was a tiny apartment and paired with the dog situation, I just wasn\u2019t happy. I told him I was not going to renew my lease as I wanted to move out of state (which was not entirely untrue), and he was ok with that. He said he was going to renew his lease, and I could just stay there and pay him til I figured out where I was moving to. \n\nHe also began expressing interest in getting a cat when my portion of the lease was up. I basically told him if you get another animal I am moving out. The apartment was already full of fur from this dog which he never groomed and I took care of the dog a lot. I also can\u2019t stand the smell of litter boxes. \n\nLo and behold, one day I come home and with zero warning there\u2019s a huge cat living in our apartment. It was ok for a week or 2 to deal with. Until he stopped cleaning the litter box so frequently and the cat became sick and crapping on the floor and on my couch. Roommate was also never home to give attention to this poor animal. So I basically got no peace at home from the cat and dog both wailing for attention, having accidents, and shedding insanely. \n\nReminder, my lease ended January 29. I informed our property manager I was not renewing my lease. \n\nSo a few weeks ago, I decided I had enough. I found another apartment in town and told my roommate over multiple times I was moving out soon over text. I informed him that we needed to get my bank account off our rental payment website, because I discovered that because we added the bank account through his email, I couldn\u2019t remove my own account. He ignored my texts for days, like would literally send me memes and ignore the \u201chey I am moving out soon\u201d texts. \n\nLast weekend, some friends helped me move out. I gave ex roomie my keys, got everything out, and again asked multiple times to please remove my account off so I don\u2019t  get charged. \n\nWell come yesterday (Saturday) I texted him again saying \u201chey dude, tomorrow is when rent is due for March. We need to take my bank off now. I have to pay rent at the new place and I can\u2019t be getting charged for the old place.\u201d \n\nHe basically responded with \u201csorry I\u2019ve been busy at work\u201d (the whole week?!) and \u201cok, well just Venmo me your half of the rent and I\u2019ll take it off.\u201d\n\nI was dumbstruck, like why should he expect me to pay rent for March when my name is off this lease and I made it clear I was leaving and signed a new lease somewhere else? I explained this to him and he was like \u201cwell I don\u2019t have rent money for March.\u201d \n\nI quickly ran to my bank which was closing in 2 hours for the weekend and explained the situation to them. They put a \u201cstop payment\u201d on my account for the old rent charge and I had to pay $36 for it. They said the old rent may still go through but it\u2019ll be returned within a day. I wanted to close the account but they recommended against it since I have my tax refunds coming through soon. \n\nI texted my roommate saying what I had been forced to do since he refused to take my account off. He flipped out at me, cursing me out and insulting me very personally. He basically made it seem like since I did not give him a \u201cformal 30 day notice\u201d I still owed him for rent for March. I blocked him on everything because I just couldn\u2019t deal with him hurling these insane insults at me. \n\nI\u2019m going to my property manager tomorrow to explain the situation and pray they can actually remove my account. \n\nMy question is- does my roommate legally have a leg to stand on? Can he force me to pay rent at somewhere my name is not on the lease? Can he hold my own bank account hostage like that and refuse to take it off his rental payment site? \n\nThanks in advance for reading this mess.",

Nancy has a brother named Mike and a fiance named John.\n\nAnton and I were going to our cousin's house, so we walk out of our front door and Nancy, Mike and John then pulled into their driveway (beside our house). Mike approached Anton with \"what did you say to my mother last night?\" and Anton said \"I said the truth\" and they got close to each other and I ran to them and attempted to break them apart. Nancy and John started screaming insults at Anton, John looked like he was about to hit me but I kept telling them to stop fighting. I was physically pushing them apart. Anton didn't hit anyone. A couple more swear words were exchanged and I dragged Anton back to our front door while Nancy, John and Mike went back to their car. All continued to scream profanities at one another and Nancy began yelling \"how could you hit a girl? you really hit me? How could you hit me?\". My mother was also present. Neither me nor my mother saw Anton touch Nancy. He is not the type of person to hit anyone.\n\nThey drive off and I go back to my room and have the following dialogue with Nancy: (note: last time I saw/spoke to her was 15 years ago)\n\nMe: Sorry about my brother's actions. What happened today was terrible. We're all family, despite anything that happens between us.\n\nHer: Thats not acceptable he hit me several times on my face.\n\nMe: Violence is for children, everyone did wrong today.\n\nMe: Yeah that was very bad of him to hit a girl.\n\nThat was my huge fuck up. I didn't know she'd use that as evidence. I only said that to appease her feelings, NOT because I believe he did anything to her. It's like when a rape victim tells you they were raped, do you immediately call them a liar? No, you appease their feelings until evidence comes forth on whether or not it's true. Legally you don't believe them, but emotionally you do.\n\nA few minutes later Anton told me I should accompany him to the police station to file a police report. We go there to find Nancy, Mike and John already there filing one against Anton. The police officer speaks to both groups (us and them) separately. Apparently, they claim both Anton and I were looking for a fight. Which is obviously bullshit because I was the only one trying to break up the fight. It was 3 against 1 (Nancy, John and Mike against Anton) not 3 against 2. If I wasn't there, Anton would probably have been hurt pretty bad, as Mike is a big guy.\n\nAnyway the police officer looks at me and says \"are you the one who sent Nancy those messages?\" and a chill ran down my spine as I realised she must have shown them to the police. My brother turns to look at me in bewilderment. The police officer mentions my messages and Anton begins crying and saying \"how could you say that? You were right there! you saw that I didn't do anything!\" and I tried explaining that I only said that to calm her down and that I didn't actually see if you did or not. He's like \"omg bro really? I can't believe you'd say that\". We go into a room with the police and we discuss everything. I start sending another message to Nancy: \"I did not see him do it, by the way. Im just going by what you claim, he isn't someone who would do such a thing\". She didn't respond. I was hoping that would kind of erase the potential of the previous message. I can't believe I trusted her to be a good person and she used my trust as evidence against both me and Anton.\n\nThey have a court date in a month. I have to be there as a witness for my brother. What do I say to the judge when they ask me what I meant by \"he shouldn't have hit a girl\"?",

The first year I worked full time and the second year I was part time.  I've had no disciplinary actions against me, and as far as I knew was on good terms with management.\n\nCut to today: I get a phone call from my GM, informing me that I was being let go effective two weeks from today (March 15th).  When I asked why, he told me that there wasn't enough shifts to go around which struck me as strange because we just had a full time bartender resign, which should have freed up 4-6 shifts a week.  So I pushed further.  He said that because times are tough, he and the other manager would be working bartender shifts.  I pushed again and he mumbled something about me not doing enough for the restaurant or something.  Since we've never spoken about my performance on the job, I am confused and a little hurt.  I always had good sales and great feedback from guests.  \n\nAnyway, the whole thing has left a bad taste in my mouth and I just want to make sure I don't miss anything that's due to me. I've got a few questions:\n\n1) Since my dismissal was not in written form, the laws that I am reading suggest that I am due 2 weeks termination pay on top of what I'll be working over my last 2 weeks.  Is this correct?\n\n2) Given that my employer cannot seem to decide on why I'm being let go, am I being unjustly dismissed?  I have no write-ups or noted performance issues.  I was under the impression that I cannot be let go without disciplinary action, or the removal of my job position.  It seems like my position still exists, but it's just being worked by other people.\n\n3) If my employer were to hire a new bartender in the near future, would that prove that I am being unfairly let go?\n\n4) Is there anything else I'm missing? \n\nThanks for your help guys\n\n(And I know it's just a low-level bartending gig, but it was my only source of income and it was very lucrative, so I'm pretty stressed to find myself looking at the prospect of unemployment",

They mislead recruits to come here with false claims about things they have and a \u201cShow\u201d dorm that is nothing like the rest, with a completely different and much nicer layout than actual living dorms ( no one is aloud to live in the show dorm) For example they are supposed to have themed food nights (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, etc) with a different food every night, such as chicken wings on Monday and something else on Tuesday. They display this information where they take recruits for tours but when students ask about it we get dismissed.

            "selftext": " \n\n\\- So basically i'm a 24 year old college student, socially awkward and anxious to the point some people thought I was a tweaker in Highschool ( I also wear a little black). I went to my class about 30-1hr late got into the building sat down and basically decided I was too late to get anything meaningful from class that day. I bolted off my chair or got up quickly (about 2-3 steps then went at a normal pace) made a sharp turn and went down the hallway to my to the exit leading to my car. There was a girl walking infront of me but I gave her tons of space and didn't walk quickly behind her or anything. She leaves through the exit in front of me and I looked for a water fountain and checked my phone for about a min before I leave. Then I left, looked for my car which isn't a common car so easy to spot, find the same car try to open the door, but it didn't automatically unlock like it should so I pulled out my keys. I hit the lock button and the car didn't respond so I figured it was the wrong car. At this point I start looking for my car and hear groans but I didn't think anything of it, I found my car and left right away.\n\n\\- I don't know if it was the girl in front of me or someone else seeing me try to open wrong car door. later when I walked down the hallway a few people passed me and said something about me being a stalker and i'm 100% sure they were talking about me. I'm literally praying that there are cameras in the building because i'm positive no one could come to that conclusion with the footage. I didn't follow/ walk with the person for more then a hallway and the people who saw me go to the wrong car should've seen me walk to my car. I could be getting Me2'd but I don't know anyone that goes to the school and don't have social media. I want to know how I can get the footage from the school and if I can post it online when I get it to clear my name. Honestly if there are only mild repercussions I will post it because fuck it. I don't know what's going to happen to me and I don't want to live with this hannging over my head for the rest of my life. I've never been in any other situation that's remotely like this, this has to be what they're talking about. I think me 2 is a really good thing for society. I know what it's like to be molested. To put me in the same group as those kinds of people hurts alot. I'm scared of talking and making eye contact with people now and am so uncertain with every move I make, I might be making things worst. I don't know if there are pictures of me with my name online and the extent of what i'm being called is. It sounded like a stalker or a predator.\n\nShould I ask around to speak to whoever is saying this or should I tell someone to pass on the message: Get the footage and delete all posts or I will see you in court for false accusation/slander. I 'm not good at confrontation and will probably start crying and embarrass myself. If it's possible to take this to court please let me know.\n\nedit: grammar and clarity.",

It's a $160 fine along with 4-8 points. \n\nThe prosecutor wants me to plea guilty but after speaking with a friend that's been a police officer for over 20 years he and I feel I did nothing wrong with not being able to see the sign from around the corner of the school, along with me stopping immediately when I see it. I also don't want points affecting my insurance for the next X amount of years for something I am not in the wrong for. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* If you can't see the stop sign out on the bus from around the corner how am I at fault?\n* Would it be worth it taking to a bench trial in front of a judge to explain myself? \n\nThe charge is an infraction - stopping a passed school bus. \n\nI appreciate any and all feedback!",

I was on my way home to drop off a cake then pick up a friend from a different location, so I was stepping on it to make it on time. Even before I saw lights behind me, I was *not* doing 90mph. Now I have a 39:4-98 for $220 and 4 points. \n\nHere are some other things that may be important:\n-Never had a moving violation before\n-I was driving a (much smaller) courtesy car since my current car is getting serviced\n-I\u2019m a college student working 40 hours a week and still taking full-time classes, so time is valuable\n-Can\u2019t afford one of those \u201c97% success rate\u201d traffic lawyers\n-Also can\u2019t afford insurance premiums if I plead guilty and pay the fine online \n\nI have no idea how to proceed from here. I would greatly appreciate advice from fellow New Jerseyans.",
